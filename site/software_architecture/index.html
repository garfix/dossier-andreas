                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this site is to give myself and other programmers a high-level easy-to-understand
                    overview of common architectural patterns in software. It is meant as a source of inspiration for those who are asked to create some program and have really no idea what it should look like or where to start.
                    I hope you enjoy it.

                <h2>Architectural patterns</h2>
                <p>
                    Each architecture is unique. However, some patterns are common in the history of software development.
                    These are called architectural patterns. At least some of them will be familiar to you.

                <h2>Control Flow</h2>
                <p>
                    Control flow describes the way activity flows through the application. For starters, an application may consist of a single process, that performs sequential executions, subroutine calls and loops. But the application may also consist of several asynchronous processes. But even if the application has only a single thread of control, it may emulate multiple simultanuous threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though a single thread can at the lowest level only do loops and subroutine calls, at a
                    higher level of abstraction it can create all sorts of control flows. Take <i>Implicit invocation</i> for example. At the lowest level it's just subroutine calls. At a higher level it's modules that become active when they receive an event that was sent earlier on by a different module. Often the application contains a specific module to create the control flow.
                </p>
                <p>I found that two characteristics stand out to describe control flow:
                <i>command structure</i> (Control Tree or Control Loop) and <i>order of execution</i> (Parallel or Sequential).</p>
