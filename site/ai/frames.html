                <p>
                    This is not a complete library. I was just experimenting with representation and reasoning.
                    I started out with some sort of semantic network. Always handy to represent Objects and Relations.
                    Then, they became frames, so I could also represent typical qualities of objects, and
                    inheritance with exceptions (the penguin is a bird, but can't fly).
                    Then I thought it would be nice to be able to reason with the relations in a Prolog kind of
                    way. So I created a unification routine that is able to make some simple non-recursive
                    inductions regarding relations.
                    This is where I stopped, because I realized I had no idea where to go next and what to do with the
                    library. There are many possibilities. And it is not a simple task to integrate all these
                    types of representation and reasoning.
                </p>

                <div class="header">What was implemented:</div>
                <ul>
                <li>Frames. A frame is something that can have any number of types (can belong to more than one group,
                multiple inheritance).
                <li>A Frame can be either an Object, a Relation, or a Type. An object is just an identifier.
                All its characteristics are not built into the object, but are Relations, multi-valued predicates
                that say something about the object. Relations may apply to all sorts of Frames.
                relations (is a kind of). These are explicit part of the objects.
                <li>Logical inference rules, which are an elementary subset of Prolog rules (like: father(x, y) :- parent(x, y), male(x).)
                </ul>

                <div class="header">Remarks</div>
                <ul>
                <li>Frames and Logical Inference are integrated. It is possible to reason logically with the system,
                but it also allows exceptions to rules (All birds fly, penguins are birds, penguins don't fly).
                All relations are represented in first order predicate logic, except for taxonomic hierarchical
                <li>It is possible to Ask the model a query. It will return bindings, all possible bindings of
                variables in the query onto concrete values.
                <li>I also considered Production Systems for reasoning, but I found them to be unsuitable for
                the simple tasks I had in mind. I don't understand why one should choose a Production System for
                logical reasoning. It's very brute force (forward chaining) and seems to be most useful for
                the kinds of reasoning used for planning problems.
                </ul>
