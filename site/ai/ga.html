                <p>
                A genetic algorithm can be really easy to implement. I made it a little harder for myself by creating a generic library in stead of
                a domain specific algorithm for some specific problem. My aim is to build tools to be used again.
                </p>

                <div class="header">What was implemented:</div>
                <ul>
                <li>Three classes and an interface. The interface (CGeneticGenome) should be implemented by a custom class describing the problem
                space. It contains all domain specific code of some problem. The first class, CGeneticModel, represents the
                genetic algorithm. It may be customized in a few ways, and excuted. This model uses a single population, of the
                class CGeneticPopulation, which is populated at initialization time. After that, the individuals of the population, the genomes,
                are changed and moved only, but not destroyed and created. This should make a lot of difference in execution time.
                <li>The model is able to handle both fixed length and variable length genomes.
                <li>The interface makes it possible to use any representation you want for the problem at hand. The interface serves
                as an interface (indeed) between the application and the algorithm.
                <li>Parent selection types (used to select parents from the previous generation to serve as parents for the next
                generation): Selection by rank, Roulette Wheel, and Tournament.
                <li>Crossover types: fixed length one point, fixed length two points, fixed length multiple, variable length one point.
                <li>Mutation types: change a gene, swap two genes.
                </ul>

                <div class="header">What was not implemented:</div>
                <p>
                Actually, this implementation is generic, but very limited. The possibilities of extending and modifying a genetic algorithm
                are large. I made a consideration between studying long on this subject to gain deeper insight in its intricacies, and
                moving on to other subjects and I chose the latter, because its more important to me now to gain a wide understanding of
                available AI techniques. I <i>do</i> believe that my architecture may be extended without to much hardship.
                </p>

                <div class="header">Remarks</div>
                <ul>
                <li>Genetic Algorithms can be addictive. The drug is to make more and more adjustments to the algorithm
                to make it find the solution in the fastest possible way. The problem for me was not to lose the generality of
                the architecture, in order to optimize the test problem I choose (the n-Queens problem).
                <li>I found that testing is very important here, since the algorithm can almost always find a solution sooner or
                later, even though you completely fucked up some of the code. At one time I removed a bug and noticed that
                the algorithm become <i>slower</i>. That was really annoying.
                <li>Since the algorithm is tweakable in so many ways, it itself is a candidate for optimization through a
                Genetic Algorithm. I leave that as an exercise to the reader :*)
                </ul>
