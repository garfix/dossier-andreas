                A simple implementation of the Decision Tree learning algorithm as described in
                chapter 18 of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach; by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.<br>
                A decision tree is the shortest amount of questions needed to establish wether an object belongs
                to some set. For example: this object is red, round, and smells sour; is it edible?
				The algorithm generates such a tree from a number of examples (objects of which you know if they
				belong to the set or not).
                </p>

                <div class="header">What was implemented:</div>
                <ul>
                <li>The decision tree learning algorithm.
                <li>The possibility to give names to all attributes and attribute values, so the decision tree may be printed.
                </ul>

                <div class="header">What was not implemented:</div>
                <ul>
                <li>Functionality to prevent noise and overfitting.
                </ul>

                <div class="header">Remarks</div>
                <ul>
                <li>If an agent wants to use this algorithm to learn which objects belong to a set and which do not,
                it will have to run the algorithm over all examples each time one is added. Also, all examples need to be stored
                for later use. This may be tedious and time consuming if there are a lot of attributes or examples.
                There are also algorithms that dynamically modify the decision tree. I don't know anything about these yet.
                <li>The decision tree is too strict to my taste. It always gives a yes or no answer, even if
                the examples contradict each other, or there is insufficient data to make a decision. It would be
                better if a decision tree could also say "probably", "probably not" or "I don't know".
                <li>The book AIMA contains an error in figure 18.8: "Hungry" branches in "No" and "Yes"; these
                words should be switched.
                </ul>

                <p>I've left parts of the code out here, to make it more readable.</p>

printf("%s\n", DecisionTree->ToString().GetBuffer());
