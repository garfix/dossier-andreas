# dossier-andreas

This project contains the data and code to generate dossier-andreas.net.

The images are not included because I don't think GitHub will approve of this amount of data.

I have placed it online mainly to make sure the data about Andreas' work is preserved when I am not around anymore.

The project creates the pages of the website from just two source files: LifeAndWork.xml (data) and Style.xsl (structure and markup). In order to build it, just run

 createAndreas.bat
 
You need some version of Java to run it.
