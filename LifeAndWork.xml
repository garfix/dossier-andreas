			Tomá&#x0161; Prok&#x016F;pek: our magazine ERA21 is issued bimonthly and each issue will contain 4 pages of
			<REF ref="s59" />. The first part will be published in #1/2003 and the last one in #6/2004.
			More info about our mag you can find at <WWWlink href="http://www.erag.cz/press/era21.asp?page_id=90" />
			(unfortunately only in Czech).
			No Andreas comics have been published in the Czech Republic yet, however Czech and Polish languages
			are very similar so Andreas is known relatively well in my country.
			(You know I work in the architectonic revue but I edit the oldest Czech comic zine AARGH
			<WWWlink href="http://www.komiks.cz/aargh" /> as well :))

				- copy PARTS of the books, not all the book<BR/>
				- parts not in french or "neederlandse taal" (in english, with not ?) in the goal to don't make concurrence with the editions on the market<BR/>
				- with the mentions of the source...<BR/><BR/>

				About the K2 book size: there was so much resistance against this clumsy size, particularly
				from the side of the bookstores, that we eventually decided to stop it.
				Now we feel the size of amongst others "De terugkeer van Cromwell Stone" to be much more suitable:
				it is still a normal album for the bookcase, but the presentation is much more "luxurious" ...
				It's a pity we didn't publish more albums in this format! Like I said: we will do "Rork - De vergeten"
				in the same way...

                Adriaan Bogaerts mentions that there are two versions of the first Dutch print.
                The first version mentions on the back cover that the second Rork album still has to appear.
                On the second version the second album (Doorgangen) is already named.
                Apparently for the first version a type of brown was used for the cover that later turns green.
                This has not happened to the second version. The same phenomenon has also occurred to the third
                album (Kathedralenkerkhof).

				Thanks to Sherpa the abandoned series Capricorne will be continued in Dutch. And thanks to Alex for noticing.
				Two albums will be released per year, starting with 'Patrick' (part 11). Note: Sherpa prints the albums strictly on demand. So you have to sign up to get a copy!
				The sign up period ends on April 1st, so if you are interested, make haste!
				<WWWlink href='http://sherpa.nu/' /><BR/>
				
				Last year <REF ref='a98' /> and <REF ref='a99' /> were published.<BR/><BR/>
				
				In March 2011, together with artists of all over the world, Andreas created an illustration for <REF ref='a100' />, an album that contains 250 illustrations about the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, to support the victims.<BR/><BR/>
				
				In December Rob Kalis created a very nice animation of Rork's movement sequence in Descente and put it on <AH href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8yt3jWLp1A&amp;context=C3c3417fADOEgsToPDskIbLnIcDtwYENOx4SrkacI' target='_blank'>YouTube</AH>.<BR/><BR/>

				Polish publisher Egmont releases the second ARQ album (that contains 6 stories), as I was so kindly informed by Karol Wi&#x015B;niewski.<BR /><BR />
				Karol also mentioned a 1985 English edition of <REF ref="a16" /> by publisher Michel Deligne. Coincidentally, Javier Vidiella named another Spanish 					edition of that same album.<BR /><BR />
				<REF ref="a97" /> has appeared (as I was told a long time ago, by Laurent Scheithauer (thank you!) and Wim Dewilde (thanks, btw I really enjoy your Twitter questions)) and Andreas has finished the drawings of <REF ref='a98' />, the 15th (and final?) Capricorne.<BR /><BR />

				Great job! Of course it is sad that it has to be done this way, but Dutch readers have a right to know how the series Capricorne continues.<BR /><BR />Andreas now has 34 followers on Twitter. He frequently shows photos of new material he is working on, which is often surprising and beautiful.

				I have been talking to Andreas, via Twitter. It is very exciting and also a bit strange (I only saw Andreas once, and I spoke him hardly at all, fifteen years ago). At the same time, it feels quite natural to talk to him and I have been asking him several questions. I invite you to do the same. Since April 5, his followers have grown from 7 to 20. The nick "Wattmanworm" is a reference to "MY Wattman Worm" in Capricorne 15, which hasn't appeared yet. Andreas liked the "Dedications" in the Images section of this site. At that point Wim Dewilde (@GajomarCama) offered to help extend this collection. So he added 12 new ones! Thanks man.

				Alex Koppert told me he had not been able to wait any longer and translated <REF ref='a83' /> himself. I persuaded him to have the document published on this site.
				Only now I bought the French "Patrick" to enjoy this powerful psychological drama Andreas created. I had been waiting three years to read this dark, gloomy, beautiful work,

				The last Rork album was released in Poland at last: <REF ref='a7' />. Thanks to publisher <REF ref='pub55' />. Karol Wi&#x015B;niewski was so kind as to inform us.<BR /><BR />
				
				I subcategorized the section "Images", because the number of images became too large.<BR /><BR />

				In November, Lombard published the French edition of <REF ref='a86' />. The album has no title and no text inside, so we will not ask the publisher to please please translate the work :)<BR /><BR />
				
				Karol Wi&#x015B;niewski notified us that the first two Capricorne albums are released in Poland: <REF ref='a28' /> and <REF ref='a29' />.<BR /><BR />
				
				Andreas did some drawings for the third album of Clarke's series "Mister President" <REF ref='a88' /> and
				for the collective album <REF ref='a89' /> (thanks for noticing, Mikaël Devaux!)<BR /><BR />
				
				Great many thanks to a contributor who sent the original picture of <REF ref='i14' />, the intriguing picture <REF ref='i10' /> and the picture <REF ref="i130" />.<BR /><BR />
				
				Pierre Loubere sent <REF ref="s118" />, <REF ref='i131' />, <REF ref='i132' />, <REF ref='i133' />, <REF ref='i134' />, <REF ref='i135' />, <REF ref='i136' />, <REF ref='i137' />, <REF ref='i138' />; thanks a lot, Pierre! <BR /><BR />
				
				I was wondering about the magazine "Hello Bédé", in which Andreas published. It appears that the French Tintin magazine was named like that from 1989 to 1993. Some googling later I found the covers of all Tintin / Kuifje / Hello Bédé covers on <WWWlink href="http://lejournaldetintin.free.fr/" /> This helped me to adapt the page <REF ref="mag1" />.<BR /><BR />

				And if all this wasn't enough... Andreas participated in a magnificent series of albums (4) <REF ref='a87' /> about dragons for which he created a marvellous illustration of a dragon spitting fire: <REF ref='i128' />.<BR /><BR />

				Turbulent times for Polish Andreas fans! Publisher Twój Komiks went bankrupt, just before their publication of the final Rork album. 
				This was especially upsetting since the publisher was, so it seems, holding on to the publication rights. Some time later publisher Manzoku took over the Rork series. 
				They intend to publish the final album and start publishing the Capricorne albums.
				In the meanwhile the Polish publisher Egmont published <REF ref="a85" /><BR /><BR />

			 <TEXT>I don't recall when the contact with Andreas first started. I interviewed him several times at the time, especially for <REF ref="mag7"/>.
			 In any case our first important project was the legal edition of <REF ref="a16"/>. when Peter Kuipers and me still worked for <REF ref="pub15"/> (publisher of <REF ref="mag19"/>).
			 The album only existed in an illegal, badly translated and lettered edition. We wanted to republish this book as it should have been done (and we did, in 1986), but
			 since we heard that many illegal albums had been sold we did not dare to print too many: 525 copies. In hindsight, we could have made much more of them. We reprinted
			 the book with <REF ref="pub8"/> (again in a limited edition, since we thought sales would be limited in this third edition) but the album appears to be a classic and may be
			 reprinted again.<BR/>
			 The most important contact with Andreas dates from this publication (Andreas drove all the way from France to Nijmegen to sign all copies at our house, and from the time the readers of
			 <REF ref="mag7"/> chose <REF ref="series1"/> as comic of the year, which we celebrated with a special Andreas-stripschrift, the publication of <REF ref="a24"/> which he made especially for Stripschrift,
			 and his visit to Breda.</TEXT>

             This is actually the first time we made a (partial) color production. The album does not exist in another edition.
			 It is contentwise very powerful, I think. It contains quite a few graphical beauties from Andreas' work, that most lovers of Andreas work don't know.
			 Just when I decided not to publish the book because of technical reasons, and to return all materials to the author, I had a good look at it and decided,
			 that it really was worth the while and had to be published.<BR/>
			 So it finally worked! (fortunately)<BR/>
			 As for the financial side: it should have been a commercially interesting book because of a cooperation with Lombard for the French market, who where at one time interested and at another time not and
			 postponed it so long eventually, that I decided Sherpa should have to do it by itself, and that we could no longer postpone it (for one thing because of the author, from whom we had borrowed the originals all of that time);
			 you can imagine I wanted to have them back in France safely as soon as possible...<BR/>
			 In any case: commercially the album will not be a success, because we made this production exclusively for the Dutch audience, and I chose not to make a limited luxe edition for 1000 fans, that I can sell expensively (and for which there will always be
			 a market) but instead an edition that is as cheap as possible and that is yet (a bit) luxurious...</TEXT>

				<TEXT>Some influences are noteable, namely that of horror-and-fantasy

				(whom Andreas introduces in the first story as the young writer
				Bernard Wright) we recognize the typical, cramped postures of the
				persons: wide spread legs and arms, tendinous hands, faces with
				mouths whose ends are drawn downwards, and the 19th century
				clothing and waving cloaks. Furthermore Wrightson uses certain,
				very conspicuous camera positions, like the bird perspective (for
				example looking into the room from between the beams of the
				ceiling). He also has a specific way of drawing lines, among
				others a specific way of indicating shadows, namely by hatching.<BR/>
				We find this in Andreas work unmistakably. In the

				recognize Wrightson's last work so precisely, the black-and-white
				illustrations for Mary Shelley's <NAME>Frankenstein</NAME>, that we
				can see this as an ode. In his strips Andreas shows that he is
				very well capable of telling his own story, even with borrowed
				techniques. He perfects these techniques as well, and uses them
				in a very personal way. For example he uses a very abnormal page
				layout and often plain spectacular perspectives.</TEXT>

				<TEXT title="Lovecraft"><REF ref="p21"/> (1890-1937), an American writer of

				The stories of Lovecraft are full of the threat of the

				<TEXT title="The Rork-syndrome">The first <EM>Rork</EM>

				Andreas will become one of <REF ref="mag1"/>'s heroes is mistaken: <NAME>Rork</NAME>
				hasn't entered a single reader's top ten.<BR/>
				For one thing, this is because Andreas' stories are not easy.
				Drawings and text require concentrated reading, and that invokes

				cannot be a coincidence that the brilliant <NAME>Rork</NAME> stories
				are replaced by the more artificial and rather boring story <REF ref="s27"/>.

				13 Stories of <REF ref="series1"/> were placed over a period of
				three-and-a-half year, with an occasional year-long inter-episode
				period. In the beginning, at the time of the stories that were
				later bundled into the first book, <REF ref="a1"/>, this
				caused few problems for the readers, since these stories were
				rather autonomous. Any way, the infrequent appearance did the
				recognition, and thus the popularity, no good.<BR/>
				The later stories, to be bundled in <REF ref="a2"/>, are
				connected and reflect previous episodes repeatedly. By means of
				flashbacks Rork's past is unveiled, and the complete history is
				finished. That was impossible to trace in <REF ref="mag1"/>. The
				later stories of <REF ref="series1"/> are too hard (or rather: too

				redaction, that waited up to a year before publishing stories, is
				to blame, but mainly <REF ref="p1"/>, a perfectionist who never wants to
				be satisfied with a result.<BR/>
				Whether <NAME>Rork</NAME> will come back is unclear. A mysterious,
				autonomous episode has appeared in <REF ref="mag26"/> 18: Cosmos
				(1982), but in <REF ref="mag1"/> the 14th episode was never placed. It forms

				<TEXT>Rork is, as we have seen, a magician. The master of dreams has

				<TEXT>A good example of how everything is connected is the story <REF ref="s2"/>.
				When Adam Neels (read <REF ref="p30"/>, an American
				comics artist) makes a sphere burst other spheres may burst as
				well. Andreas doesn't explain exactly what occult relationship
				exists between the spheres, but does make Neels explain his
				invention: <QUOTE>One places a sphere between the rings... places
				the needles against the sphere... and spins the <EM>flying
				sphere</EM> twice... notice the pattern of lines that is
				drawn... () In all this mixup of crossing lines there is always
				one point where five lines cross. It requires only a light
				pressure to...</QUOTE> and the sphere bursts.<BR/>
				At first one is inclined to think that the sphere that was
				placed in the device has gone weak by all the markings on its
				surface. But that doesn't explain the synchronous exploding of
				other spheres of the same volume that are positioned elsewhere.
				We must thus presume that Neels has a much more fascinating
				theory: every sphere has a weak spot, and with his device he is
				able to determine this spot. The bursting of all kinds of spheres
				proves his theory, and he is proud of it.<BR/>
				To the magician Rork it is a small leap of thought to then
				imagine the earth's sphere, and a nut that discovers that fatal
				point on the earth's surface. <QUOTE>All right, agreed</QUOTE> says
				Neels, <QUOTE>that has occured to me... but who would be crazy
				enough to saw through the branch he is sitting on?</QUOTE>
				Rork: <QUOTE>Exactly, a nut... or... yes, indeed, a nut...</QUOTE>
				Neels: <QUOTE>O, You always exaggerate! You spoil my beautiful
				invention.</QUOTE><BR/>
				Rork holds something back, but we can guess his thoughts: the
				same way Neels can burst the spheres in his laboratory, an alien
				power, to whom the earth is a mere toy ball, can burst the earth.
				What happens to us on a small scale (microcosmos) can happen
				elsewhere on a large scale (macrocosmos).<BR/>
				A minute later the events start to follow up rapidly as the
				villagers, that have had some hindrance of the side-effects of
				Neels' experiments, decide to destroy Neels' cabin to end it all.
				At that moment Neels has to admit that he has found the fatal
				point already, and has build his cabin on top of it. Almost
				immediately a supernatural force lowers <QUOTE>an enormous mass</QUOTE>.
				Lucky for us Neels has made a mistake in his calculations.
				Understandably, since he is unable to build a device of suitable
				size for thís calculation.</TEXT>
			</Comment>
			<Comment showAt="s2">
				<TEXT>We then return to Andreas' precision. At the moment Rork
				reaches Neels cabin (2nd page) we can see a kind of ivy growing
				above it. If we watch really carefully we can even see a cable
				and a hook in it. This is a detail we probably won't notice, but
				it returns at the 6th page. The page, in which Neels explains to
				have build his cabin on top of the fatal point, offers a <EM>top
				view</EM> (bird perspective) on the cabin and the people running
				towards it.We can see clearly that the cabin has been hung up
				with these cables between two trees. Alongside these cables the
				ivy curls. Thus Neels was afraid the weight of his cabin alone
				could mean an overload of pressure to the earth's surface.<BR/>
				The bird perspective through which we see the cabin is
				therefore not only very pretty, but very functional as well. And
				it certainly is not the only thing that is extremely effective:
				when at the same page the mass in the form of a giant needle
				descends from the sky, Andreas uses a picture that spans the full
				height of the page. For the impression of the needle in the
				earth's crest he chooses a large picture, to do justice to the
				giant proportions of the needle. For the picture in which Rork
				and Neels conclude that <QUOTE>somewhere up there () there is a
				power that is after our planet</QUOTE> Andreas takes a frog's
				perspective to also show the starry sky above. One star is
				blue...the color of the needle! Andreas uses more techniques very
				functionally to tell his stories. For example his use of color,
				or the composition of the pages.</TEXT>
			</Comment>
			<Comment>
				<TEXT>Andreas picks his colors with care. For ordinary scenes the
				colors are more or less realistic. In <REF ref="s9"/>
				the dreams of the ten year old Rork were depicted in
				conspicuously bright colors, to express the living experience of
				a child. <BR/>
				Impressive is Andreas when he uses shades of merely one or two
				colors, like in the flashback in <REF ref="s11"/>,
				that is done in brown and grey, and the passage scene in <REF ref="s10"/>,
				in which the color changes from purple-violet to blue-grey.</TEXT>
			</Comment>
			<Comment showAt="i5">
				<TEXT>Andreas' attention to colors expresses itself in other moments
				as well. Thus at some point he had to make a summary of past
				stories for <REF ref="mag1"/>, because they had waited a long time
				with the publication of the sequel. This page <EDITOR><REF ref="i5"/></EDITOR>
				Andreas shaped into a disc, with Rork in the middle and the figures that stage the
				episodes around him, each story a segment of the circle, that
				isn't closed since the story isn't over. This page was printed in
				black-and-white in the album <REF ref="a1"/> but in <REF ref="mag1"/>
				it appeared in color. It was performed as a colorful disc: the
				segments of the disc each were performed in shades of one color,

				yellow through green to blue, purple and red. The center space,

				<TEXT title="The composition of the page">Andreas uses increasingly
				stranger looking pages in the course
				of the stories. He uses page layouts we have only seen at Crepax,
				like pages with oblique pictures, or full of small fragmentary
				images. One can find very beautiful pictures of Rork. Let's take
				the first two pages of <REF ref="s10"/> as an
				example. The first page offers us a view of the room. We look
				through the beams of the ceiling into the room. We can see books
				everywhere, and Tanemanar and Rork are just going outside. The
				second page consists of six page-wide pictures below each other,
				in which we come from high above Rork and his master, going down,
				while approaching the two persons, and then, still descending,
				move away from them again, until at last we find ourselves far
				below Rork and Tanemanar. Across this page you could, so to say,
				draw two diagonals: the camera that moves from the upper left to
				the lower right, and the persons moving through the wood from the
				lower left to the upper right.<BR/>
				This is not only tightly scheduled and esthetically sound; it
				is also - and that what important in a strip - very functional.
				At the last picture the two persons approach from the woods to an
				abyss, into which they will descend shortly. Through the fast
				lowering of the camera the reader is already standing below,
				making the abyss appear to be very deep.<BR/>
				The same way we can look at the next pages in the same story,
				in which Andreas draws huge monsters (large picture), followed by
				a descending Rork and his companion (small pictures, read from
				top to bottom), followed by the beast breaking through the
				ceiling (vertical picture, read from bottom to top).
				Experimental, indeed, but remarkably well readable, and thus well
				thought through.</TEXT>

				<TEXT title="Images and text">Every strip is told with texts and images. Text and images

				sombre, savage forest. The people of the village rarely dare to
				go there...</QUOTE> The image indeed shows us that sombre, dark

				falling on a treetrunk. The image contradicts the text, more or

				having a very dramatic effect. The text reflects the conversation

				the images show what happens concurrently, elsewhere, between the

				for real, I would like very much to live in one. They are not boring average

				<Q>You must be crazy about drawing.</Q>
				<A text="p1">(laughs) Yes, indeed I love to draw. My problem is
				that I am a limited draughtsman. My illustrations are never
				really good and they take me a lot of time. I am more of a
				storyteller. I admire artists that commit a good drawing to paper
				with great ease. With me the result is always less then I had in
				mind.<BR/>
				For one, I wasn't satisfied with the scene with the ships,
				because I could not get enough contrast in it. Of course I am
				content with many of the pictures, but not about the larger share
				of my images.</A>

				<Q>Yet a renewed version of Mil has appeared in French.</Q>
				<A text="p1">That only involved a few altered pictures. The original

				already, the publisher wanted less pages, so I deleted two pages.
				These are added in the renewed version. The story runs smoother
				now. Also I have separated the black-and-white and color-pages
				from each other. I had made them seperately and mixed them in the

				<Q>Are there any albums about which you are satisfied?</Q>
				<A text="p1">I'm still satisfied with <REF ref="s58"/>, but mainly about the

				fantastic element. It worked out reasonably well, I think. The

			<Comment showAt="p1">
				<Q>Why do you like to draw fantastic things over real things?</Q>
				<A text="p1">Because I am a too limited draughtsman to draw realistic
				things from daily life. That might be the reason I work with
				transformations. It's much more difficult to draw a man sitting
				in an armchair in a normal way, because then it should look
				natural. Classical draughtsmen like <NAME>Juillard</NAME> master this drawing
				technique. While drawing I always encounter my limits as a
				draughtsman. Yet I am not an unhappy man, because I happen to
				like drawing fantastic stories. My drawing style fits perfectly.<BR/>
				When I started out as a strip draughtsman, I used to make
				humorous work. I still like to apply transformations in my
				illustrations, like in the more charicatural strips I used to
				make. I like to give theatrical poses to my personages. My
				drawing is more constructing than sketching. I never even make
				presketches.</A>

				<Q>In your debut album, <REF ref="a13"/>, you
				nevertheless tried to draw realistically?</Q>
				<A text="p1">I did that because it worked fast, not because I am having
				trouble drawing realistically. The documentation and drawing
				technique <EDITOR>This technique is called, in Dutch,
				<EM>schaafkarton</EM></EDITOR> took a lot of the time. In the
				chapter about <NAME>Agatha Christie</NAME>, for example, I used only
				photographs. I was in a hurry and the story had to be finished
				quickly. I would never do that again, though, since you are only
				copying and not really drawing.</A>

			<Comment showAt="series1">
				<TEXT>You can't just say <REF ref="series1"/> is the story of a lost soul
				from another universe desperately trying to return. That would be
				too simple, since Andreas Martens has, as spiritual father of <NAME>Rork</NAME>,
				let us known more than once, not to do any concessions to his
				readers. Yet it is all too easy as well to depict <REF ref="series1"/>
				as a Faust-story with a modern, silverhaired Cagliostro. If there
				exists a relationship at all between Goethe's <NAME>Faust</NAME> and <NAME>Rork</NAME>,
				it goes no further then the passing of the border to another
				world (death). An interesting world of course, yet one that
				offers few paths through the entrance.<BR/>
				Rork is not only a personage from a story, he is also a <QUOTE>token,
				or thought, in the sence of creation</QUOTE>, we read in <REF ref="s14"/>,
				page 24. The adventures of the main character hence are
				linked to what the thought or the idea has to endure. Where the
				personage Rork steps from one world into the next, we can wonder
				through which worlds the idea Rork travels. When the person Rork
				fights his enemy Mordor Gott, it could be nice to know the
				relationship between the idea Rork and crime. And when the person
				unveils the secret of the cathedrales' cemetery, the idea takes
				on a position against religion.</TEXT>
			<Comment showAt="series1">
			</Comment>
				<TEXT title="The Story"><REF ref="series1"/> is of course in the first place about a
				remarkable man that has the possibility to travel from one world
				to the other, or rather to <EM>pass</EM>. This
				<EM>passing</EM> is at the same time restricted: it can only
				be done when you are initiated and it can only be done twice.
				Anyone passing more than twice has to face Pharass, the guardian
				of the secret of passing.<BR/>
				In <REF ref="a2"/> the inevitable happens: the person Rork
				passes once to many and is tracked down by Pharass, who takes
				away the (memory of the) secret, yet cannot prevent that Rork
				crosses once more and as a result is caught between two worlds.
				Which implies that there is a Nomansland between two or more
				worlds.<BR/>
				This is the information we get from the first two parts of the
				cycle. <REF ref="a1"/> and <REF ref="a2"/> can thus be
				regarded as an introduction to the rest of the cycle. This
				separation is confirmed in several ways. As not to divert too
				much, I recall only two of these ways: from <REF ref="a3"/>
				the cycle counts from <em>Rork 1</em> to <em>Rork
				5</em>; and from <em>Rork 1</em> every part has a clear prologue
				(<REF ref="a7"/> has no prologue but an epilogue) and a
				<EM>framework conversation</EM> held by two owls.<BR/>
				In <REF ref="s12"/> Rork appears to be not as
				lost as is suggested at the end of <REF ref="a2"/>. He is
				merely held captive by the <NAME>liers of Vree</NAME> who regard themselves as
				the conscience of worlds or even that of fate. Rork is accused of
				disturbing the balance in his universe and <QUOTE>a universe
				that is off balance wavers other universes</QUOTE> (amongst
				which the one of the liers of Vree. <REF ref="s12"/> p.
				15). Therefore Rork is sent back to his own world to restore
				order. Once back in his world he engages in several meaningful
				surroundings and situations. At first he is stranded somwhere in
				a jungle where he finds his strength back on a cathedrales'
				cemetery and meets a future allie. In <REF ref="s13"/> he
				refinds Low Valley. In <REF ref="s14"/> a confrontation with
				organized crime follows and an alliance with the astrologer
				Capricorne, in <REF ref="s15"/> he finds himself in a spaceship
				that is hidden under the ice of the polar area. In <REF ref="s16"/>,
				at last, a good attempt is made to tie together all loose ends.</TEXT>
			<Comment showAt="series1">
			</Comment>
				<TEXT title="Themes">When we follow the threads of the story, a number of things
				that are of interest to the idea Rork return again and again. To
				start with, there is the generally mythical, that is at one time
				expressed by underwatermen (Atlantians?) and at another time by
				extraterrestrial powers or earthly forces.<BR/>
				Furthermore there are passages that curiously always are
				connected to death. For instance, the first passage starts with
				the death of a ferryman (markable detail: the captain that shows
				Rork where to go somewhat later turns out to be dead as well) and
				the second passage is accompanied by the <EM>suffocation</EM>
				of Rork. The third time Rork is literally crushed and when Rork
				at the fourth time is sent back by the <NAME>liers of Vree</NAME>, this
				passage coincides again with the end of a life (that of <NAME>Levec</NAME>
				through the very remarkable detour of the poisoning of Miss McKee
				who thereby avoids a certain death). Then there is the passage of
				the emissary of Vree in <REF ref="s14"/> (the man dies
				directly at arrival) and the passage of Rork in <REF ref="s15"/> that
				saves him (of a certain death?). And finally the passages in <REF ref="s16"/>

				can similarly be connected with death. It seems obvious that
				Andreas uses passages to symbolize a kind of controlled dying.<BR/>
				Except for the inexplicable and death we are regularly confronted
				with all kinds of religious aspects. This starts in <REF ref="a1"/>
				when Rork enters a subterranean temple, in chapter 4. The
				religious references only become clear in <REF ref="s12"/>,
				in which the keepers of the dungeon (Mordor Gott,
				the criminal from <REF ref="s14"/>?), the liers of Vree (in
				priest's garment) and the cathedrales are obvious religious
				elements. But there are further elements. In <REF ref="s13"/>
				Low Valley is called a priestess of initiation, in <REF ref="s14"/>
				we meet Mordor Gott and his <EM>cubic temple</EM> and in <REF ref="s16"/>
				not only some rituals come to the attention, but several other
				religiocities are repeated partially.<BR/>
				Then there is the theme of appearance and reality. The most
				concise clue to this is the <EM>passage</EM> of Raffington
				Event at page 7 of <REF ref="a2"/>. The man enters Rork's house
				to immediately step out of it again...to turn back again by a
				different way!!! And Rork's comment at page 9 is no less concise:
				<QUOTE>Let's say that you and your contemporaries are too
				quick to assume what they see... As soon as one knows what it is
				you want to see, one can make you believe anything. Be on your
				guard.</QUOTE> And from that moment on it is a great gamble to
				the attentive reader where <REF ref="series1"/> is about appearance, or
				about reality.<BR/>
				What at least appears to be real, is the neverending fight
				between good and evil that is elaborated in <REF ref="s14"/>
				as theme of so called pulp fiction novels. By the way, it is in
				this part that religion is degraded to mafia and the strongest
				clue is the person Kenton. This Kenton is porteyed in the pulp
				novel as an aid of the criminal Mordor Gott (in monk's frock) and
				can furter on in the strip be found on the side of the <EM>good
				guy</EM> Capricorne. This betrayal towards Gott costs him time
				and again a piece of a finger, a ritual that is used in cases of
				betrayal with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia.<BR/>
				As a fifth and last theme the theme of time can be
				pointed out. This theme probably forms the connection between all
				themes of the Rork-cycle. In <REF ref="s16"/> this is developed
				expressly. That is where we learn that a number of places
				together form the face of a clock and that the grandfather of
				Wilbur Skiffel had theories about the vibrations of time and
				consequently designed a gigantic timepiece. One of the mechanisms
				appears to consist of the places forming the dial and the house
				of grandad Skiffel that is build L-shaped and thus forms the
				hands of the clock. When grandson Wilbur starts this special
				mechanism, vibrations are created that coincide with the release
				of a gigantic monster, that appears to be the creature that was
				<EM>locked up</EM>; in the subterranean temple of Low Valley.</TEXT>
			<Comment showAt="series1">
			</Comment>
				<TEXT title="Return">By summing up the different themes we still don't know how to
				associate these with the idea Rork that all this was about. The
				answer most likely can be found in the last part: <REF ref="s16"/>.<BR/>
				In <REF ref="s16"/> we get for the first time answers about Rork's
				origin and about the contents of the thought behind Rork. At page
				44 we can read for example that Rork comes from a world where
				quietness rules and from which at a certain moment he is born,
				without the interference of biological parents, into our world.
				What eventually is his mission in this world remains rather dark,
				yet from what Rork says to Dahmaloch at page 53, we can
				confidently conclude that it is his task to save the world from
				destruction.<BR/>
				The danger threatening the world is that man could succeed in
				achieving chaos or perfection. According to Rork it is rather the
				road from one thing to the next that is the ground for man's
				existence. Rork states himself as a saviour to a possible
				drifting off to hell and the devil. Rork the idea, the thought,
				as it appears from his words at page 53, should actually be seen
				as resistence against the temptations of the devil (this is of
				course where Faust comes in).<BR/>
				Remains the question what temptations are presented to us by the
				devil. At page 45 we get a clue to this. Rork there tells a dying
				Low Valley: <QUOTE>in what kind of world are we living, that
				bleeds and dies the moment it comes in contact with reality?!
				Let's hope, Low, that the dreamer doesn't dream forever! That he
				wakes up one day and sees things as they are and not as he wants
				to dream them, under the pretence that life is what he wants, not
				what he is! All we do here is mere cheap mysticism...</QUOTE><BR/>
				If everything what we do here is but cheap mysticism that makes
				us flee from reality, it is apparent that the five main themes
				mentioned earlier can be seen in that light. The test if this is
				true looks like this:<BR/>
					- man perpetually tries to find explanations for matters
					  that at first aren't explicable by <EM>normal</EM>
					  scientific means. No wonder it feels good to think that
					  it is about extraterrestrial business or about
					  <EM>Atlantisbusiness</EM><BR/>
					- whereever passages are related to death, we can add
					  mysticism to the images many of us have of dying. Thus,
					  passage appears at one time to be an entrance to the
					  cosmos (Rork in <REF ref="a1"/>), the next time an
					  entrance to new life (Rork's escape from the dust), hell
					  (<REF ref="s12"/>) or the dream
					  (<EM>young Rork</EM> in <REF ref="s16"/>);<BR/>
					- next, religion is a very appetizing source of mysticism.
					  In the Rork-cycle the main source of mysticism is the
					  representation of the powers from which religious power
					  is drawn. In <REF ref="s12"/> they are
					  earth rays, combined with a mystic energy coming from a
					  circle of erect stones (think of the stones of
					  Stonehenge). And Gott thinks in <REF ref="s14"/> he
					  has the religious right to speak by the availability of a
					  <EM>cubic temple</EM> with certain powers;<BR/>
					- and then: what's the difference between dream and
					  reality? How often we make attempts to unravel the
					  mysteries of dreams. And is it not strange that young
					  rork in <REF ref="s16"/> passes the passage of the dreamer
					  to end up at Tanemanar's. Tanemanar, who is part of
					  Rork's dream, yet is so real he leaves his traces in the
					  snow. And is not the cheap magazine in <REF ref="s14"/>
					  not an exquisite example of escapism, a flee from
					  reality? But what is appearance and what reality?;<BR/>
					- finally there is the mysticism about the fight between
					  good and evil that takes place at different levels, yet
					  finally culminates in the fight between Rork and
					  Dahmaloch. The question is only whether that fight is not
					  really a fight between evil and evil, since the essence
					  of evil seems to take posession of Rork's body at page 38
					  of <REF ref="s16"/>. However it may be, the mysticism of
					  this fight is not very clear, unless one seeks it in the
					  fact that the fight originates in the quest for absolute
					  power by those who want to use the power to their own
					  advantage.<BR/>
				Remains the theme of time that plays an important part in <REF ref="s16"/>.
				This time invokes questions, like the other themes have. What is
				this: time? Is that a solution to the problem of chaos (the liers
				of Vree form a timecircle at page 11 as a last resort to the
				upcoming downfall of their universe)? Is it also a passage to
				other worlds? Is it a carrier of mans road to hell and doom?
				Whoever knows, may say so.</TEXT>

			<Comment showAt="series1">
				<TEXT>It's impossible to try to explain the entire <REF ref="series1"/>-saga. There
				are too many palliatives and last resorts in it, because the
				first two parts, <REF ref="a1"/> and <REF ref="a2"/> were
				meant to be autonomous by Andreas. Only several years later
				Andreas picked up the thread of <REF ref="series1"/> with <REF ref="s12"/>
				and succeeded to make a well
				constructed whole of it. Despite the palliatives and last resorts
				in the story, Andreas does present a vision with <em>Rork</em>.
				An vision on reality and creation.<BR/>
				'Rork' means token or thought, in the sense of idea, creation (<REF ref="s14"/>,
				p.24). Tokens are eventually the only thing that remains of
				the entire <REF ref="series1"/>-saga (<REF ref="s16"/>, p. 56). Rork is
				thus something universal, a universal train of thought. In any
				case it is immediately clear that Rork is not human. He is
				several hundreds years old and possesses the power to travel
				between several worlds through so called passages. <BR/>
				At the end of <REF ref="s16"/>, the last album of the series, Rork
				commits suicide by jumping of the skyscraper of Capricorne (p.54,
				pl. 1). This jump is Rork's last passage, he returns to his
				own world as owl.<BR/>
				Earlier on Rork had discovered who he really is. At first he
				recognizes a token on a wall in the sewers of New York, that
				clears the fog in his mind (<REF ref="s14"/>, p.36). Later in
				the spaceship on the South Pole all things come together when
				Rork looks in the mirror (<REF ref="s15"/>, p.49). The token
				reminds Raffington Event of two birds (<REF ref="s16"/>, p.44). <QUOTE>Indeed</QUOTE>,
				answers Rork to this. The token thus simply represents the two
				owls that are waiting at the beginning and end of every <REF ref="series1"/>-album
				since <REF ref="s12"/> for the return of a
				loved one. This loved one is Rork and eventually Rork will indeed
				return to the owls, to his own world.<BR/>
				What, then, is this world of Rork? He himself says to his friend
				raffington Event at page 44 of <REF ref="s16"/>: <QUOTE>In my
				world rules quietness. But sometimes the sound of large, wooden
				pipes awakes us... It happens seldomly and the last time it
				created confusion at first. A threat that was outlined against
				the horizon entered through your world. Now I know it was only an
				illusion. When the spirits had calmed down, I was taken through a
				passage. It was my first time, I was inexperienced. At the end of
				the tunnel, I was only a baby.</QUOTE><BR/>
				This explaines how Rork suddenly entered our world as a foundling
				(<REF ref="a2"/>, p. 10). He entered our world to stop a
				danger, a danger that is personified in Dahmaloch and eventually
				appears to be nothing more than an illusion. Pharras, (a pawn of
				Dahmaloch) tries more than once in vain to disable Rork. The
				original world of Rork is one of ideas and symbols.
				Significantly, the owl is the symbol of wisdom and is the meaning
				of Rork's name idea. Besides wisdom, the owl symbolizes death.
				[1) Andreas himself wrote about the owl as symbol: <QUOTE>I wanted
				to use birds in Rork and opened a birds encyclopaedia. I saw a
				picture of two owls and found them suitable. I was just looking
				for a strong image, like I found a cathedrales cemetery a strong
				image. In hindsight the symbolism of the owl came in very
				handy.</QUOTE>] Significantly Rork returns to his world only
				after his suicide action.</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="World">Rork entered our world, after being awakened by <EM>the sound of
				large, wooden pipes</EM>. Since the era of Enlightenment we in
				Western Europe think everything can be explained by human ratio.
				This train of thought lead to a view of the earth as on ordinary
				lump of clay without mythical elements and without a god. At page
				12 of <REF ref="a2"/> young Rork leaves this rationalistic
				progress-thought, by posing that there aren't as many answers as
				their are questions, but that there is always one question more.
				With this, Andreas makes clear in one sentence in what kind of a
				world Rork has landed. Rork lives in a cosmological world, one in
				which human reasoning hasn't demythologized life.</TEXT>

				Rork knows that man doesn't live in reality but in a self-made
				reality. Thus everything appears to be nothing more than
				mysticism, an illusion. At page 53 of <REF ref="s16"/> he

			</Comment>
			<Comment showAt="series1 p32">
				<TEXT>Andreas' message is a philosophic one, comparable to
				the German philosopher <REF ref="p32"/> (1788- 1860). According to
				this thinker the world consists of two layers: that of will and
				representation. The world of will is the true world, that
				underlies every idea man suggests about what this true world
				really is. Every representation of life creates its own reality.
				The will is within ourselves and is inexplicable, it is the urge
				that leads us <EM>from one thing to the next</EM>. Man nevertheless
				seeks desperately for an explanation for that will. He forms
				ideas of religion (<REF ref="s12"/>), gods of

				or a extraterrestrial power (the spaceship in <REF ref="s15"/>).
				All these ideas are only <EM>cheap mysticism</EM>. The more so because
				the reality that is created by such an idea starts to live a life

				<Q>Who says Andreas, thinks immediately of Rork. Don't you have the

				<A text="p1">No. It's normal that the name of an author is attached to that
				of the character he has created. Rork is after all the hero that has revealed
				me as a scenario writer and draftsman of strip cartoons. During a very
				long time, it was also my only series published. Now there is <REF ref="series2"/>
				and I hope that within a few years, without forgetting Rork, the readers
				will associate my name with this new creation as well.</A>
			</Comment>
			<Comment showAt="series2">
				<Q>This new creation refers nevertheless to Rork...</Q>
				<A text="p1">Not exactly. It's true that I've <EM>tested</EM> Capricorne while
				I realized the Rork saga. At a certain moment, because I knew that this
				series would not go beyond seven albums, I wondered what I was going to
				do afterwards. That's how the character of Capricorne came in and how he
				gave his name to an episode of that saga. Since the latter had to
				evolve a little in the same universe, I have made him do a sort of
				screen test, with the intention to give him, thereafter, another orientation.
				Having said that, the two series are totally independent. One doen't have
				to (re)read one to understand the other. Chronologically, the history
				of Capricorne starts before that of Rork. Their meeting is just one of
				the accidents of their existence. Besides, I will refer to it when I arrive
				at that period in Capricorne's adventurous life.</A>
				<Q>Could you specify the identity of this very enigmatic character?</Q>
				<A text="p1">His strange history takes place in the thirties. His identity?
				He doesn't know that himself. It will form the subject of a forthcoming
				album. I can't reveal this to you yet. Let's say it's about an adventurer
				who settles as an astrologer because it seemed to him to be a lucrative
				profession. It enables him to see the future at ease and to live through
				several especially fantastic adventures.</A>
				<Q>Adventures planned in the long run?</Q>
				<A text="p1">Contrary to Rork, where everything evolved step by step, and as result
				of the adventures I had caused in the preceding episode, I know already
				in general how the adventures of <REF ref="series2"/> will continue. from the beginning
				I designed a frame which will develop on several albums. I especially wanted
				to realise a series which addresses the general public by simplifying my
				proces of narration. There will be something that I call a red wire, Capricorne,
				but each episode will give place to a history that stands alone and whose
				comprehension doesn't require constant reviewing of what preceded. What
				I had done in Rork by complicating in a more or less conscious way the
				situations, I will do here much slower and thus much easier to assimulate.
				Without asking too much effort of him, I thus hope to lead the reader to
				get passionate about more complex subjects. As I always did in all my albums.</A>
				<Q>Is that also that which has brought you to adopt a more traditional
				setting in images?</Q>
				<A text="p1">In <REF ref="series2"/>, that which imports me above all, is the clearness
				of the account. For this I have simplified the drawing and my formattings
				also are less sophisticated. That said, I didn't give up some graphical
				audacities. If the history lends itself to it, while taking care to preserve
				a great legibility, I don't say I will stay with the same setting out of
				(cartoon)boxes. For the moment my narration is relatively traditional,
				therefore the illustration is relatively traditional.</A>
				<Q>Are you not afraid that the reader is disappointed not to find there
				the graphical audacities which contributed to your reputation?</Q>
				<A text="p1">It's true that graphical virtuosities are expected of me. But
				certain albums of Rork were already illustrated in a traditional way. Once

				again, al depends on the scenario! If the account requires a fragmented
				formatting (of the pages), I will do that. If on the other hand, I should
				insist on a very linear narration, I will do that too. There are no rules...
				For Capricorne, I haven't fixed the number of albums. It's
				a series that will continue as long as the readers want it. ...</A>

			<Comment showAt="series7">
				<Q>Precisely, if you could tell us something about the series you have
				just started at <REF ref="pub9"/>?</Q>
				<A text="p1">Let's say it's a science fiction serial that will be spread
				out over several albums. That will possibly be frustrating for the reader
				who has to wait for the next episode to find out about the rest of the
				story, but the system of publishing volumes of 46 pages obliges me to stop
				each time the continuity of the account. This series, that will start in
				October, shows five characters who will find themselves projected in a
				parallel world... That's all I can reveal for the moment. The word <NAME>Arq</NAME>
				that gives his title to the collection, refers to that other place whose
				characters are prisoners. I wanted a short, somewhat confusing name, that
				doesn't occur in any language.</A>
			</Comment>
			<Comment>
				<Q>Confusing, isn't that after all the adjective that characterizes you best?</Q>
				<A text="p1">My aim is not to confuse. It is rather to encourage the reader
				to make a small effort. I would like people to realize that in a comic
				strip one can cover ambitious subjects. I would like a public series like
				<REF ref="series2"/> at <REF ref="pub1"/> leads one to discover more elaborated work like <REF ref="series7"/>
				at <REF ref="pub9"/>. The strip cartoon offers a much wider range of possibilities
				of expression than to which one confines it today. I would like things
				to evolve a bit. When I began, a lot was published and often it was of
				no importance, but in the heap there were some very interesting achievements.
				All was possible and I believe that creators like Bilal, Tardi or <REF ref="p71"/>
				couldn't have made themselves known without the opportunity of this abundance
				of production. That what they do isn't always easy to read and yet, they
				are succesful. That's why I think that one doesn't necessarily have to
				propose things with the short-nap cloth of the fitted carpet to satisfy
				the general public. Furthermore, if I had to simplify extremely, I would
				find no pleasure in it at all and I would prefer to abandon it all.</A>

			<TEXT>1981, A year to mark a white stone in the career of ANDREAS. In effect, a German living in Paris and drawing for belgian magazines, ANDREAS publishes - at a french publisher! - in the beginning of the year, his first album "Revelations Posthumous" on scenario of François RIVIERE. Like many other draftsmen of its generation, it is the mythical "How to become draftsman of STRIP CARTOONS" (with FRANQUIN and JIJE! Miam! Miam!) that will cause the young ANDREAS to be diverted right way to slip along the slope of the vice and the cartoon... At the end of the book, an address: that of a school - in Belgium - which gives courses of STRIP CARTOONS. Once read, he left at once, and we find him on the benches of the workshop STRIP CARTOONS of Saint-Luc Institute in Brussels. It is at the end of the second year that he decides to follow in parallel the courses of PAAPE, the famous creator of "Marc Davier" and of "Luc Orient". After some time, he takes ANDREAS for an assistant. They undertake then "Udolfo", a realistic series - on scenario of DUCHATEAU - which will appear first of all in TINTIN before being published in limited edition at a small editor. ANDREAS performs the pencil sketches and PAAPE the inking. Then he decides to fly on his own wings and creates, always for TINTIN, a series in which he assumes all alone the full realization: "Rork". We find there a fantastic atmosphere that is reminiscent of LOVECRAFT - that ANDREAS read a lot. It is precisely LOVECRAFT - the great fantastic american writer - which is the main character of the first "Révélation Posthume" that he carries out with RIVIERE for the magazine (A SUIVRE). Started more than two years earlier, this series is not only remarkable for its scenario, but also by the technology rediscovered by ANDREAS to accomplish its boards: that of the card to be scratched ("carte à gratter")! "I take my drawing which I reproduce with the back of a yellow sheet of copy. I then transfer it on the chart which I scrape while following the dotted line and while working my grayed"</TEXT>
			<TEXT>Tools? "a pin inserted in a wood stem makes an excellent point; or, for the thicker features, a vaccine point..." The result is superb, stunning but... "It takes very long, It takes much more time to make a board in chart to be scratched that with Indian ink. And then, it is necessary to avoid being mistaken... if not, it is necessary to start again!"</TEXT>
			<TEXT>To note in your notebooks: you will soon be able to see in Brussels, Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Toulouse, Aix-en-Province an exhibition of the originals of ANDREAS. Opens the eye!</TEXT><BR />

				<TEXT>
					Of all our young stripbook authors, Andreas is doubtlessly the most controversial. Noone is indifferent to his work, and that is a sign of quality. Everyone agrees about his drawing talent, however, both fans and professionals. "And yet, I would have never reached this level if Jijé had not strongly critised the few plates I dared show him. I hadn't expected any compliments of course, but these were complete bashings! Enough to discourage the most stubborn beginner. To me this was an enormous shock. I have to say that what I drew at the time did not match what I felt. I had not yet succeeded to determine my own original and personal style. Yet, rather than to give in to despair, I went back to work. I did my best to find my own way. At first as a draughtsman I was strongly influenced by people like Franquin, but eventually I chose a more realistic approach, inspired by certain American draughtsmen. The unconventional way they treated a scenario strongly matched the way I wanted to tell my own story for so long."
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT>
					In Bruxelles Andreas mastered the art. In Sint-Lucas he takes a course by Claude Renard, and later, in Sint-Gilles, the one by Eddy Paape. "In Germany, where I was born and made my first drawings, the comic strip did not evolve the way it did in Belgium and France. There is not a single school where you can learn about it. I dreamt a long time about the trade and saw only one solution: to emigrate. The Belgium school of comic strips had an international call and therefore it was logical that I moved there. Afterwards I settled in Paris... and eventually I arrived in Bretagne. I like the misty coast in that region. The landscape is fantastic and the people are both reserved and warm. There I find the rest I need for my work. Actually, this may be because of my northern upbringing, I never felt drawn towards the sun. But this Brettonic grey breathes an athmostphere of mystery strengthened by the countless remains of its Celtic past."
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT>
					Mystery...that is what pervades his stories.
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT>
					"Even as a boy I was fascinated by everything that had to do with strange and paranormal phenomena. And later, in my trade, I never felt completely well if I did not work with these subjects in my text and images. I say: text ànd image, because to me the one can never be without the other. In general scenario writers are much too talkative. They tell all kinds of things that can be expressed more clearly and often better in a drawing than that it can be said...That is why I prefer to be my own scenario writer.

					Opinions about comic strips vary widely. Some say that a good page is best created in black-and-white. I on the contrary think that color adds a lot. Not just esthetically! It was no coincidence or joke that in <REF ref='s27' /> the story began in shades of grey, then turned to bright colors, later to return again to grey. It all has to do with symbolism. The colors speak their own language. Especially when it comes to the expression of feelings. I hasten to say that my fantastic story always start from explainable situations. By characters remain humans, who are suddenly confronted with something unusual."

Along with that, the subjects he treats, fuzzy and mysterious as they are, are often somewhat disconcerting to the reader unused to his unconventional writing style. "The cave of memories", whose second part now commences, resembles personal experience even more, that is lifted up from the fantastical to the metaphysical. We wanted to know it for long. But only today we dared to ask...</B><BR />
					"First of all you need to know," Andreas explains, "that these two complete stories make up a larger single story of 50 pages. To me it is important to emphasize that this is about a larger whole, of which the deeper meaning becomes clear only when the following parts have been read. That was one thing. Furthermore, it will come as no surprise that my thoughts and imagination is strongly influenced by many witness accounts of the old Celtic civilisation one still finds in Brittany - where I live. The idea of this story came while reading the works on druids and Celtic religion. A religion that has completely disappeared, blown away by Christianity, and seemed to me to be very liberating as compared to this Christianity with its stringent dogmas. I let the druid concepts work in on me. The Celtic ideas of death and the hereafter have made a great impression on me. I thought I could use this "relevation" and came up with the idea to reconstruct paradise as the druids saw it, by adapting it to our time and let the story play in the sombre regions of northern France and southern Belgium. We are situated in our time, in the industreal area with many coal mines and iron mills. Hence the sombre and monotonous-grey colors. My hero, who has not been initiated the the druid mysteries, has a strange experience: he enters a hostile world, that looks familiar at first, but soon turns out to be the land of death. Because he doesn't know the laws that govern this land where he considers himself to be lost, he has some unpleasant experiences at first. But isn due time, when he learns to read the tokens, he discovers...but it will leave this for you to discover...<BR />
					The fact that I have been fascinated by Celtic mythology so profoundly is no doubt because it matches  my personal imagination. But perhaps also because it tightly linked to the German fairy tales and legends I heard in my youth. You will find the same names, concepts and gods. But don't think that all this constantly occupies my mind. I am certainly not tormented by thoughts of death. As of the hereafter... I was never really occupied by it..."

				<TEXT>The reader of <REF ref="a2"/> will not only be impressed by the drawing art of Andreas
				but also the the quality of his stories: what surprised me above all was how Andreas made
				the characters of his first album reappear, and how he managed the tie all loose ends together
				in the final episode. In <REF ref="a2"/> many events of <REF ref="a1"/> are reflected, but
				in a more meaningful way. Those of you who want to know how Rork continues need to purchase
				<REF ref="mag26"/> 18: Cosmos (1982) now. This will now enlighten you much, however, because after

				<TEXT title="Cromwell Stone">
				After a mutiny thirteen passengers of the "Leviticus" were put overboard in a lifeboat without
				food or water. As by miracle the shipwrecked were saved; since then they hold a yearly reunion.
				For ten years each year one of them disappears ...<BR/>
				Just before the latest reunion Cromwell Stone receives a letter from one of the reunionists, offering him
				to stay over at his place, so they can visit the reunion together.<BR/>
				The letter doesn't comfort Stone entirely, and as he wanders through the abandoned town late at night
				he imagines that he is being spied upon (see our frontplate). His fear gets bigger and bigger and overcomes
				him, in the end, in front of a house, as he collapses unconsciously.<BR/>
				Next morning it becomes clear that he has slept at the address where he was supposed to be; the house
				is for rent, however, and an old neighbour cannot remember the person Stone is looking for ever having
				lived there. Stone decides to rent the house, which starts a series of fateful events.</TEXT>

				<TEXT>Leaving the story for what it is, as not to give away to many details, I can delve briefly into
				the drawing. It's hard not to be impressed by the care with which Andreas thinks of every detail of
				his world and works it out in his drawings. But if this story, that was prepublished in 1982 and 1983
				in <REF ref="mag12"/> is published in A4 format in black-and-white as well, the weaknesses in Andreas'
				approach become clear: Andreas always wants to put <EM>every detail</EM> of his inventively created worlds
				on paper. To put it simple, he completely fills all his pictures; in the case of <REF ref="a16"/> one
				can even say its crammed, because Andreas not only draws every object, but also the materials out of which they
				are created, and the shadows they cast on eachother.<BR/>
				The drawings of Cromwell Stone are masterpieces of technique each on their own, but fail in the point of view
				of 'readability'. The story demands an edition in <EM>color</EM> (by means of color the elements of a drawing
				can be separated, important details can be put up front, minor details can go to the background) <EM>and</EM>
				on <EM>a larger format than A4</EM>. But anyone who has seen <REF ref="pub1"/>'s edition of <REF ref="a2"/> knows
				what (some) publishers are capable of. If the album is translated at all.</TEXT>

				<TEXT title="Cythraul">On the rocky coast of Brittany Cythraul sails into a cave. Behind him the entrance
				collapses. He discovers a subterranean world and starts a search. The ones he meets do not give him a direct answer,
				but do ask him what he hides in the package he carries under his arm.<BR/>
				<REF ref="s27"/> appeared in 1983 and 1984 in <REF ref="mag1"/>. The story is kept quite simple; the number of
				events is small. The symbolic layer of events makes the story less transparent: the reader can't get around the
				question what the reason of the events is.<BR/>
				In the pictures Cythraul's experiences are separated from his memories by respectively thick and thin borders.
				The pictures have been kept 'empty', the pages are laid out spaciously. The rather undifferentiated use of color,
				the odd angles of view and the, by the use of lines, <EM>realistic</EM> expression of <EM>charicatural</EM> characters
				yet make the comic not very clear.</TEXT>

				<TEXT title="Cyrrus">A young man is reading a paper in a room. Their is a knocking on the door. He opens the door:
				<QUOTE>Hello! I'm your mother. ?.. Yes, that's right! I remember! Come in, madam	!... Please sit down!</QUOTE><BR/>
				The young man and the woman sit down at a large table. Both place a hand on the tabletop, the largest part of which
				does not show the structure of wood, but a drawing of a large labyrinth. In the graybrown space the yellow colored
				laryrinth glows strangely.<BR/>
				End of dream.<BR/>
				In this new story, wherein a young archeologist, Cyrrus Foxe, is the main character, Andreas tells several stories
				at once: time and space change all the time and the connection between the various fragments only gradually becomes
				clearer.<BR/>
				So it's a complex story that asks the full attention of the reader. But in the meanwhile Andreas has perfected his
				technical abilities: the layout has become more quiet, the contrast of the drawings has increased (still using a lot
				of detail!), as is the use of color, thereby reaching new heights.<BR/>

				<TEXT>Comics can be read and interpreted on several levels. On the level of entertainment it only matters to let time pass in
				a pleasurable, loose, way. The pictures are observed superficially and the accompanying text is partly swallowed. It needs to
				be said that most comics can be enjoyed at this level only, often because of staggeringly ill-written stories. Yet some
				white ravens can be found in the small world of comics. Marten Toonder is such an author and draftsman of stories who
				invites both for entertainment as for a quest for the dungeons of Ollie B. Bommel's (and thus Toonder's) soul. In his work plenty
				of symbolism (dream -, literary, and archetypal symbolism) is available.<BR/>
				Andreas isn't afraid of the heavier work, either. His stories are crammed with symbolism, in which feelings and problems in
				disguised form represent Andreas' struggle with appearance and reality. It is filled with true emotion, straight from the heart.<BR/>
				<REF ref="s27"/> can be enjoyed on the level of entertainment and as a <EM>Celtic failytale</EM> with it's main theme <EM>the battle
				between good and evil</EM>. The main actor in a theatrical company is killed by an adversary within the group. The perpetrator
				represents evil. With this deed he tries to gain the powers of the dead man. His desire for power drags him down. He is killed
				by falling rocks. In the twilight zone between life and death his soul seeks its destination. The epilogue is told by a druid
				who points out in what way the soul should be taken to paradise.<BR/>
				The pictures experiment with odd compositions. The sphereful scenes are set in horizontal, vertical, or arced borders, seen from
				different perspectives.</TEXT>

			<Comment showAt="s27">
				<TEXT>Diving deeper into the comic story the alert reader stumbles upon a great number of symbols. According to the Swiss psychologist
				Carl Gustav Jung, who lived from 1875 to 1961, a symbol is a sensory representation of something surpassing the represented. A deeper
				meaning is mentioned which is perhaps not understood by all, possibly sensed by many and only completely grasped by a handful of people.
				In <REF ref="s27"/> the masses, who sense the symbolism somewhat, will have to do with the mythological story that accompanies the symbol,
				for further explanation. In this case it is overly clear that Andreas is so fascinated by <EM>religion</EM> that he used the battle
				between good (represented by God the father, Christ the son and Mary, the holy spirit) against evil (personified by Satan or Lucifer)
				as feeding soil for this epic.</TEXT>

			<Comment showAt="s27">
				<TEXT>In doing so, he stumbled on primal images (so called archetypes), that originate from the collective unconscious. The <EM>Self</EM>,
				the total of a personality, is such an archetype. This greater Self (many times greater than the ego, the small I or I-awareness of man)
				expresses itself according to Jung in fourfolds in a cross form or in a circle (mandala) and is the expression of the totality of man.
				The <EM>Shadow</EM>, an archetype as well, the so called evil (that is not really evil, but repressed) is symbolised in Christianity by
				the <EM>devil</EM> and can be regarded as a supplement to the Christian trinity. The <EM>Holy Ghost</EM> (in Hebrew a feminine word) and
				Mary collide; thus forming the following fourfold:</TEXT>
				<TEXT><IMG src="resources/cross1.gif" align="middle" width="281" height="243"/></TEXT>
				<TEXT>The fourfolds always express themselves in 3+1, 3 good and 1 evil or 3 conscious and 1 unconscious, or 3 ends of the cross are short
				and 1 long, but also in 3 men and 1 woman, 3 young persons and 1 old. In the story of Andreas is Jean DeVille (Devil) the shadow, who
				comes to consciousness. The treasure he craves represents the Self and this treasure can't be conquered by violence. They who want to
				conquer the Self by violence will be destroyed by violence. And so Andreas makes it happen. Jean DeVille encounters himself as a dying old
				man (page 23). He has died then already, but by this confrontation he realizes his Self through death. This way drawing and story telling
				reminds one of the Bardo Thödol, the Tibetan book of the dead. Stumbling through the twilight zone of death Jean meets an old woman, the
				archetype of <EM>Anima</EM>, leader of souls and intermediary between the I and the unconscious Self. Jean obviously hasn't made use of
				the Anima (the female) in himself; as earthly being he had a pityful underdeveloped consciousness. The fourfolds in this story correspond
				to those of Christian doctrine, as depicted above:</TEXT>

				<TEXT>Above all we are pointed to <EM>four</EM> cities, <EM>four</EM> wise men (pages 26, 27, 28) and the <EM>four</EM> blissful islands
				(pages 55, 56). Kadern represents, like Balder and Christ, the Self in the form of the dying god/hero, sacrificing himself for gaining

				consciousness (the treasure in the box). Man keeps looking, however, for that which is there internally already by nature, yet covered
				by many veils: the Self.<BR/><BR/>

				<A text="p1">In <REF ref="y1960"/> my parents moved to the West. That was in the year before the Berlin Wall was built. Of Eastern Germany I recollect some things

				Actually there weren't any real comics in it, just pictures with texts below
				them. In 1975 or 1976 I reread them during a voyage to Eastern Germany. Only
				then I noticed how strongly ideological they were colored, real propaganda.

				<A text="p1">In Western Germany I soon switched to Mickey. That magazine was forbidden in
				the DDR. Actually all that was forbidden in the DDR appealed to me. All they
				knew there from the West were Fix und Foxi and other weak Disney-lookalikes.
				Animal figures engaged in adventures couldn't amuse me. But the publisher of
				Fix und Foxi - and later on some other magazines as well - started publishing
				the French and Belgian comics Robbedoes, Asterix, Lucky Luke, and Johan en
				Pirrewiet. And those really impressed me! For the first time those drawings
				did something to me, especially the ones from Robbedoes. Not so much those of
				Asterix, they were too perfect. I didn't realize it so much then, but with
				Asterix you tend to forget that they are drawings. You don't have that with
				Robbedoes. Franquins' drawings always fascinated me. In that time he was my
				idol.</A>
				<Q>How old were you then?</Q>
				<A text="p1">It started when I was about thirteen, fourteen.
				I didn't know then that it was Franquin drawing Robbedoes,
				beause they never showed the names of the authors. That happened only much
				later, back then I only knew the comics. Later, when when I was at college,
				I got French lessons. I'd have to say that I was not a good student
				in that field, until I discovered that those comics were made in French.
				Then I started buying Robbedoes albums, during vacantions in France
				and around it, sometimes I ordered them by mail. I started with Dupuis
				albums, later those of Lombard and Dargaud. Those comics were not
				the only support for the French lessons at school. It also helped that I
				read started reading books and listened to the Belgian radio because they
				used to interview draftsmen. I was completely fascinated, a real fan.
				That's how I got the hang of French. I didn't really speak it well,
				but understood what they said on the radio and what I read.
				The wordgags in Asterix I understood only much later.</A>

				<A>My community (military) service I also did in Düsseldorf.
				I was a telephone operator in a hospital.
				Soon I did nightshifts, which didn't require you to do much more
				than be present for six hours. So I could draw pictures to my
				heart's content, which I did with determination, since I still
				had the ambition to make comics. In the daytime I slept and in
				the evenings I drew. Therefore I didn't really waste time.
				After that I went to Brussels.</A>
				<Q>None of the drawing from that period was published?
				It didn't result in any comics?</Q>
				<A text="p1">No, but that was not the point. I was influenced
				very much by Franquin: large feet, big noses, humour.
				A bit of adventure, but with funny characters.</A>
				<Q>Do you still own these drawings?</Q>
				<A text="p1">I still have drawings from when I was sixteen,
				charicatures of teachers. After that I soon switched to
				notebooks in stead of in the margins or on separate sheets.
				This resulted in a large collection of old notebooks containing

				<Q>Then you arrive in Belgium. When was that?</Q>
				<A text="p1">That was in 1973, I was 22. I spent three years at
				Saint-Luc and two years at the academy of Sint-Gilles. Saint-Luc
				is a sort of general art academy, with courses on architecture,
				illustration, sculpting, and the like. There was one
				comics workshop where <REF ref="p5"/> used to teach for years. I started
				there the year he was succeeded by <REF ref="p69"/>. Then it was called
				<EM>Atelier R</EM> with the <EM>R</EM> of <EM>Recherche</EM>
				(Research). Renard had been a student-assistent of Paape and
				replaced him without having any professional experience.<BR/>
				I find it hard to talk about Saint-Luc, because in retrospect
				I think I didn't learn much there. In any case regarding comics.
				The drawing lessons, working with models and perhaps even the
				course art history were definately interesting. But there were
				also completely useless courses, like philosophy or literature.
				And during modelling classes we were busier throwing
				clay at eachother than anything else. In the comics workshop
				we sometimes had compulsory assignments and sometimes we could do
				what we wanted. Renard made his round amongst his pupils
				to talk about their work, make corrections, and such.
				Later I realised that it was all very much without engagement.
				It was always like: <QUOTE>Yes, not bad, but maybe
				there you should...</QUOTE> Never something specific like:
				<QUOTE>No, this is not right; yes, that is right; here's
				how to do it...</QUOTE> If you don't have any previous knowledge,
				such an approach is not likely. Furthermore, there was a sort of
				breach with the rest of the world. Everything that happened at
				school was <QUOTE>fantastic</QUOTE> and everything else
				<QUOTE>worthless</QUOTE>. With the exception of <REF ref="mag13"/>
				there were only idiots, people without any sense. This trashed
				my idols completely - except for Franquin and maybe Moebius,
				who were considered geniuses. In three years a sort of
				coccoon formed in which everyone told eachother
				<QUOTE>Great, what you're doing.</QUOTE> But it wasn't really
				all that much. With that luggage we wouldn't have found a
				job at any magazine, any publisher. As an example: at a
				given moment we asked for a course on writing a scenario and
				we got a course on semantics! Not that it was completely useless,
				but we never learned to write a scenario. Actually we never
				learned to tell a story at Saint-Luc.</A>

				<A text="p1">If so many people went to Saint-Luc, it was only because

				Because the Saint-Luc is not only a higher education,
				you can start there just after elementary school with art history,
				anatomy, drawing lessons, etcetera, until the final exams of
				secondary school. The people who went through all of that
				were great draftsmen. But sometimes they were afraid and
				stopped just as soon as they left their schooldesks.
				They were not really motivated to make comics. One started
				working in a restaurant, another - a real genius - at a bank.

				<Q>After Saint-Luc you went to the Academy of Sint-Gilles?</Q>
				<A text="p1">At the same time, I think, at the end of the second year.
				<REF ref="p5"/> started a new course at a small academy two hundred
				metres from Saint-Luc. A French friend of mine had taken a look and
				told me: <QUOTE>You should come too, it's really good.</QUOTE>
				Then I went too. I believe that virtually everyone from Saint-Luc
				followed Paapes lessons at the same time. It was exactly what
				I was looking for: down to earth, do it so-and-so,
				little rules. It had its own limitations, but it taught me
				more than Saint-Luc. It has given me the foundation to do
				what I wanted to do, and add some external influences.<BR/>
				Paape gave precise directions, something to hold on to.
				He gave you assignments like: a car arrives at a house and stops;
				someone gets out of the car, enters the house,
				gets back into the car and the car takes off. Dat was an
				exercise he had used for years. <REF ref="p69"/> always told us that it didn't matter:
				<QUOTE>You don't need to make such an exercise, it doesn't work like that...</QUOTE>
				And yet it mattered! When we left Saint-Luc, noone could just make a plate
				displaying a simple action. We could hardly tell something accurate and simple.
				Even during our time at school most students realized something was wrong and
				developed a kind of reaction. Especially <REF ref="p70"/>, who was always very
				critical and somewhat withdrawn, had conflicts with Renard. Renard in turn
				rejected Duveaux' work completely. Eventually Duveaux was the first
				to publish something after he left the academy. In short I also
				disagreed completely with Renard.</A>

				<A>Saint-Luc was interesting for other reasons,

				<Q>What happened after Saint-Luc and the Academy?</Q>
				<A text="p1">Yet I hold good memories on Saint-Luc, because of the
				friends and aquaintances it has left me. We shared the same passion,
				we all wanted to do comics. After Saint-Luc I worked with <REF ref="p10"/>,
				<REF ref="p11"/> and <REF ref="p9"/> for - I don't remember exactly how long
				- six to twelve months. We had rented some space and made a workshop out of it.

				not had time to draw the story. He asked me if I wanted to sketch it.
				In the beginning I wasn't fast enough for him of course: he inkted in a flash,
				while it took me three days to do the sketches. He called me continuously.
				That was good, because he taught me to work under pressure.
				Currently I like to work fast as well to remind myself that I'm telling a story!
				If you are working too long on a plate - making <REF ref="a23"/> I spent up
				to three weeks on one plate - you seem to string standalone illustrations

				The editors were very uninterested. When you delivered the plates you were told:
				<QUOTE>Yeah, yeah, put them over there!</QUOTE> Nobody was really interested in them.

				<Q>You called this album the most succesful album of that time.

				<A text="p1">I think the story is less complicated than most

				are gaps in it. I don't really remember what I wanted to do
				exactly. If I was to reread it, I might stumble over some
				things myself. Especially when Cyrrus disappears, his
				transitions from one place to the next. He disappears
				and returns, while it isn't even said if he steps out of time,
				to later return again, or that time itself stops. The latter
				is unlikely, because Cyrrus disappears while the lives of the
				others continues.</A>
				<Q>The biggest problem with <REF ref="s41"/> is its strange
				concept of time. In <REF ref="s40"/> the story split into

				<A text="p1">Oh, I don't see it as a <QUOTE>difficulty</QUOTE>.
				To me it was really the first step in the elaboration of what

				<Q>In an interview with <REF ref="mag7"/> you emphasized the
				importance of family relations in <REF ref="s41"/>. It easy to
				conclude that the comedians of 1924 are the missing children on
				1972. It's also clear that Mil is the child of Virginia Leix,
				and Jewel is the daughter of Kilkenny Leix, Viginia's brother.
				Does that mean that when Cyrrus calls Jewel his niece in 1924,
				he is thus a reincarnation of Mil?</Q>
				<A text="p1">It is exactly the other way around, Mil is a
				reincarnation of Cyrrus.</A>
			</Comment>
			<Comment showAt="s41">
				<Q>And when Cyrrus merges with the ghost image of Virginia,
				it clearly expresses an incestuous relationship. A
				relationship that sort of matches the first deed of incest,
				when Virginia is sucked in by her son before they go back
				in time. This seems to be the central theme of <REF ref="s41"/>.
				You find it in the tense relationship of Leix and his daughter
				Jewel: he forbids her to leave the parental house, she
				blames him to track her down in time, and at the end they
				find themselves exactly opposite eachother in the temple.
				Thus the story seems to display two versions of an incestuous
				desire: either the permanent tension of a torn desire,
				or to enact the inenactable and to create a monster.
				Seen this way the dream of the first plate gains a clear
				meaning.</Q>
				<A text="p1">Yes, that I recognize anyway. At the end
				Mil's mother meets Cyrrus. Be it that I view Mil and
				Cyrrus as more or less the same person, as a reincarnation.
				And that again is the reason why, at the point where the two
				stories meet, Mil unties himself from his mother and continues
				his journey. A complicated story after all! I don't think
				I will ever try it again!</A>

				Maybe the story is a little too close to what I experienced at
				the time: I really tried to get out of a depression. Family
				life actually didn't appeal to me at all at first. That
				means, having a child and all the fuzz around it. I believe
				that's also present in Fantalia. That's also why I like the
				movie Eraserhead by David Lynch. He made the film when his
				wife or girlfriend was pregnant and thought that from that
				moment all was over for him. He just left the filmacademy
				and thought that he could never again do what he wanted,
				never make the movies he wanted anymore, because he had
				to sustain his family, etcetera... That was not my fear.
				My fear was that there would suddenly be someone who
				would be there all the time. I had lived alone for years
				and I liked that very much. I was very open to people.
				That is less now, because currently I see people every day.
				I see my family everyday and in a sense that is enough for me.
				I have that closed side about me. I like to be at home and do
				not like to be disturbed. Not many people visit my workshop.
				After some years I found out that the workshop really
				terrified my wife and daughter. I went there too much,

				<Q>We thought the image of the woman holding a windowlike

				<A text="p1">I also wondered for a long time where she came

					Many of these creations belong to the fantastic. The cycles of Rork (7 volumes),
					Capricorne (5 volumes) and Arq (4 volumes) are the best known, but some of his other
					productions (Cyrrus, Fantalia, Aztéques, Le Triangle Rouge)(3)  are equally intriguing,
					enigmatic, and difficult to classify according to the traditional styles.<BR/>

					His work often strikes the reader as difficult. Rather than in the gothic universe
					of the stories or in the virtuosity of the graphic style, the real interest of this
					author lies in the exploration of the narrative possibilities of the medium. Each of
					his productions can be read as a reflection on the graphic novel, its reader,
					and the act of reading.

					A first look reveals that Andreas's work, without by any means being limited to this,
					draws regularly on the twists and turns of the fantastic -- monsters, buildings
					oozing with anguish, time and space distortions, the theme of fragmented identity,
					and a style that does not scorn the effects of the "gothic tradition." An analysis
					of the particular sets of themes which support this fantastic universe may prove
					interesting, and research into the origins of this author's production could help
					enlighten us as to the connections between the imaginary worlds that meet in the
					sagas of Rork, Cyrrus, and Cromwell Stone. These three sagas have indeed come into
					existence within a quite limited period of time(4), and they are all based on the tension
					and disorders induced by the presence on Earth of a fragment of "another reality,"
					which will have to be returned to its source. These similarities between the
					frameworks are further reinforced by the recurrence of certain elements which resemble
					each other closely(5). The kind of approach that we propose here should, however, reveal
					some rifts and shifts in this set of themes of the fantastic, given the fact that
					the <EM>exo-fantastic</EM> (denoting improbability in terms of "alterity"(6) ) is replaced by
					the <EM>endo-fantastic</EM> in some of Andreas's recent works(7). The fantastic of Coutoo,
					for example, rests entirely on Toby-Toby's and Coutoo's altered identities, which
					will be studied below. In the same way, the disturbing tension that we feel
					in Le Triangle Rouge stems from the confrontations generated by the will in its
					desire to master the strata of the universe of dreams, which may be thought of
					as intimate and supremely indomitable at the same time-precisely because of its
					refusal to submit to the rules of will and even of consciousness.

				<TEXT title="The Representation of the Fantastic">
						From its very beginnings, however, research into the fantastic has shown how little
					its specificity can be attributed to its thematic register only. Most of the elements
					used in the fantastic can indeed be found in other narrative perspectives, and,
					conversely, some fantastic accounts are based on frameworks which make only minimal
					use of such elements.<BR/>
						The fantastic appears to be an effect of both representation and figures. It is, to use
					Bellemin-Noël's apt words, "a way of telling" (Bellemin-Noël, 1972). Producing this
					"effect of the fantastic" entails essentially a shift from the universe of the characters
					to that of the reader, i.e., an ontological hesitation. This fundamental fissure is
					at the basis of the fantastic and the tensions of the irreconcilable that it evokes.
					As an effect of reading, the fantastic invites us to go back to the processes of
					representation by which it has been generated and which connect an author's personal
					practices to the expressive layers of a specific medium.<BR/>
						Writing about Andreas, and especially about his works <REF ref="series6"/> and <REF ref="series5"/>,
					Thierry Groensteen has used the term "hystericalization of the medium"(8) to refer to the
					organization of the steps which allow the author to "materialize the impalpable".
					He describes the main procedures of this "frantic and almost mediumistic" style(9) ,
					which turn Andreas's work into "a machine of which all mechanisms converge to throw
					the senses into a panic and to deprive the reader of his rational points of reference."<BR/>
						On the other hand, Jan Baetens, in an as yet unpublished study (Baetens, 1997),
					shows us to what extent the effect of the fantastic seems to rely on an opposite strategy in
					other works by this author. With <REF ref="a13"/> (Andreas, 1991), we are far from
					a hyperbolization of expression; on the contrary, an extreme restraint of the author's
					figurative potentialities is evident here: the effect of oscillation(10) is brought about
					primarily by creating tension with the codes that are characteristic of the medium itself.<BR/>
						The studies mentioned above will guide the observations below. Whereas these studies
					focus on the effect of the fantastic on the stylistic and modal levels, we will try to
					introduce some insights from a more specifically narrative perspective.<BR/>
						We will limit ourselves to two examples from Coutoo (Andreas, 1989) and the
					cycle of Cromwell Stone (Andreas, 1984 and 1989) concerning the same issue, i.e.,
					the opening sequence of the story. The opening sequence and the incipit in particular occupy
					a special position in the mechanism establishing the contract between the author and the reader.
					Would there be strategies specific to the opening of a fantastic story, or, more precisely,
					are there any fantastic openings of the story in Andreas's work?

				<TEXT title="Coutoo: An Incipit of the Improbable">
				<IMG src="images/figures1.jpg" width="350" height="459" /></TEXT>
				<TEXT>	The first page of <REF ref="s58"/> (see Figure 1) appears as a singularly disconcerting incipit(11).
					The first reading leads one to notice an opposition between the scene at the top of the
					page and the one in the last panel. Characters and places differ: we do not know
					how to integrate the space in the last panel with Pestrone's apartment. Two cultural
					frames are also present: Italian-western (the paradigm of violent jealousy punctuated
					with Maa, Basta...) combined with an odd mix of traditional Africa and modernist
					settings (the circle of fetishes, Toby-Toby's clothes, and the architecture).
					But this juxtaposition, already intriguing in itself, becomes definitely disturbing
					as soon as the two universes have to be seen as interconnected: the character at
					the bottom continues the rejoinders of the one at the top! Moreover, all the
					principles of composition used on this page inescapably lead us to this
					inconceivable confrontation. The Toby-Toby character, in the large panel, has
					some characteristics in common with Gina above him: sitting like her, in frontal
					position, he is perfectly aligned with the panels in which she is shown. Moreover,
					Pestrone's dance of gestures and words, which literally surrounds the "column" formed
					by Gina's two panels, seems to recur in the last panel, with the displaying of
					balloons around Toby-Toby. As to the text, the interconnection of the two scenes
					assured by the continuity of the dialogue from one scene to the other is intensified
					by a very felicitous slip of the tongue. As a whole, Pestrone's angry speech is
					relatively precise: he states, orders, interrupts, gives information, expects answers,
					challenges, interprets; but one retort stands out because he hesitates,
					"There's aphro...somethin' 'r others!" This wavering in the flow and the vague
					meaning (something, others) makes a phonetic jump possible from "aphro"
					(aphrodisiac) to "afro" (African), i.e., a double meaning that allows the two
					signifiés to be part of the universes of both the first and second scene.
					Moreover, this balloon is perfectly aligned with Toby-Toby's vertical axis,
					in the "column-space" which runs across and unites the two scenes(12).<BR/>
						Thus, the opening page of Coutoo has a similar impact as some of Escher's
					most popular patterns (Samson, 1987:11), in which the fantastic effect stems from
					the confrontation between the codes of realism and the "irreality principle" of
					an "improbable totality" (Bessière, 1974). Confusing the reader in Coutoo's opening(13)
					represents more than a simple surprise effect: his first attempts of building a reality
					with the current codes of probability will be proven ineffective(14).<BR/>
						Moreover, far from clearing up a misunderstanding, the next pages do nothing
					but increase this feeling of confusion: on the second page, Toby-Toby becomes the
					bearer of an additional voice, but it is especially the third page (see Figure 2)
					which serves to confuse the reader even more. From the outset, this page makes a
					complete formal split from the first two pages. The chromatism and the typography are
					radically different. The verbal elements change from dialogue to narrative.
					Moreover, the regular format of the panels and the recurring space, represented
					consistently from the same angle, are in opposition to the changing point of
					view which characterized the first two pages.<BR/></TEXT>
				<TEXT><IMG src="images/figures2.jpg" width="350" height="459" /></TEXT>
				<TEXT>
						In addition to these formal differences with the preceding pages, the third
					page also organizes a systematic game of jumps in the reading action. The first-person
					narrative mode may, during the reading of the first few panels, give the illusion that
					the only represented character is the bearer of these thoughts: this illusion is
					broken in the sixth panel where he is referred to with "Like this guy!" The fixed
					point of view and the movement of the victim-to-be towards the front of the stage
					can lead us to assume that the classic aggressor's point of view in a situation of
					suspense is represented (see Figure 2). This idea dissipates in thin air in the
					last panel, when the aggression comes from an unexpected angle. At this moment,
					the reader may infer from the narrative in the previous panel ("I can imagine the sound")
					that, rather than a "directly shown perspective," a reconstruction of reality by another
					character is presented. More precisely, the reader is shown how a character--the reader
					of the file (page 4)--reconstructs the way another actor has reconstructed a scene
					he has never been part of! Additionally, at this moment in the reading process,
					it becomes almost impossible to integrate this new information with the parts of
					the story already suggested in the first two pages.<BR/>
						Far from confusing the reader gratuitously, this opening sequence aims at introducing
					the specific elements of the fantastic which rule this story at a pragmatic level.
					Andreas makes the realm of the mystery novel tip to the fantastic by putting the fundamental
					unit of character and voice between parentheses. Building on this tension, the narrative
					will produce a disturbing opposition between a character that has several "voices" (15)
					and a "voice" portrayed by several successive characters. (16)<BR/>
						With Coutoo, this essentially fantastic motif is made particularly effective through
					the sophisticated use of this narrative system. By using the possibilities of a mode of
					expression suited to the comic strip, Andreas confronts us with situations of improbable
					juxtapositions and successive dislocations in the narrative.

				<TEXT title="The Return of Cromwell Stone: The Strangeness of a 'Déjà-vu'">
						With <REF ref="s55"/>, the fantastic becomes fixed in a more classical
					set of themes of the relationship between man and fragments of alterity. But as an
					element in a series--a sequel to a previous volume--the challenge in this volume is no
					less precise. According to Todorov, a fantastic story loses part of its evocative power
					during a second reading. Because all doubt has been dispelled, any re-reading of a
					fantastic story becomes a kind of meta-reading (Todorov, 1970: 95). So how could the
					feeling of hesitation and confusion, which is so characteristic of the fantastic,
					survive at all? In The Return, indeed, the story takes the traditional path of the fantastic
					and stages the quest of an innocent character/narrator trying to come to terms with a
					reality beyond his comprehension, in which he has to face his shattered perceptions.
					But this in itself is hardly enough to restore the experience of sensory friction in
					the reader-besides, what Todorov said about a re-reading can also be said about a story's
					sequel. How can we re-establish this feeling of confusion in a story where the elements of
					the fantastic are already familiar and have been put in context in advance? In fact,
					far from trying to minimize this effect of re-reading, Andreas uses it as a stepping stone
					to develop other narrative strategies aiming at the fantastic effect.<BR/>
						The opening page of The Return of Cromwell Stone (see Figure 3) does not, unlike
					the one in Coutoo, attract attention by the construction of an improbable reality. On the
					contrary, the Andreas reader is rather struck by a strange feeling of familiarity,
					a "déjà-vu." The reader cannot but compare it to the opening page of the first story
					of this cycle (see Figure 4), which it recreates in theme as well as composition.
					This recreation is both meticulous and strangely shifted. Just as the incipit-page of
					the first Cromwell Stone, it is structured around a composition with two similarly
					proportioned panel sequences (about 2/5 and 3/5 in height), and it presents a similar
					distribution in the panel sequences: the top panel sequence consists of five panels,
					and the bottom panel sequence is filled by only one image. We also find the same
					distribution of elements (one character is running towards the right in the top
					panel sequence, and the building to which the character is running is shown on the
					bottom panel) and the same system of focus: zoom-in in the top panel sequence, general
					overview in the bottom panel sequence, with quite similar postures on certain panels (17).
					To this, we can add the recurrence of a quotation in the bottom image (18).<BR/>
						However, paradoxically, the similarities of these incipit-pages
					(see Figures 3 and 4) help bear out some distinguishing characteristics that are
					essentially thematic (19).  The male character is replaced by a young woman; the
					feeling of salvation (At last!) becomes one of dejection (I can't bear it anymore!)(20).
					Besides, the mineral elements (rocks, cliff) and aqueous elements (sea, rain)
					that dominated the first incipit have now been replaced by an abundance of vegetation
					(trees, herbs, plants) and full darkness after dusk. The most significant element,
					in this play of similarities and differences, is reserved for the reading:
					the quotations seem to fit together and react to each other. The first quotation ends
					with three suspension points, whereas the first word of the second quotation,
					"because," is preceded by three suspension points. Thus, the second quotation seems
					to be an explanation of the first one: "Fear is the oldest emotion of mankind
					because man is but a tiny creature...(21)
						Despite the constant plot shifts in the volume, the feeling of familiarity
					initiated on the first page does not diminish during the reading (22),  and the composition
					of this incipit-page becomes emblematic of the narrative strategy in its entirety,
					since this volume actually resumes the first one, both in its general conception
					and in its set of themes.<BR/>
						Similar structural effects are used in both volumes: abrupt narratives,
					multiplying flashbacks, and even second-level flashbacks (23),  so that the reading oscillates
					between three distinct but interlaced levels of temporality (24).  Even the frameworks of
					these narratives seem to echo one another: here again, Cromwell Stone returns from Europe
					to America by boat; here again, the "key" is on board; here again, "wreckers" will step
					in during the crossing; here again, Stone and his companion will come back to Loatham,
					revisiting places that are still recognizable, despite the invasion of vegetation--Stone's
					house, the water tank, the enigmatic tower. Thus, the title, The Return of Cromwell Stone,
					has a threefold meaning: the return of a character who has been away for ten years,
					the return of a character to the site of his past adventures, and the return of the
					framework of the first volume.<BR/></TEXT>
				<TEXT><IMG src="images/figures3.jpg" width="550" height="361" /></TEXT>
				<TEXT>
						Surprisingly, this familiarity does not diminish the effect of the fantastic
					in the narrative. On the contrary, it constitutes the very essence of this effect. With
					The Return of Cromwell Stone, the reader is not simply confronted with a series of events
					that is innocently added to those of the first volume. Instead, the linearity of the
					chain of events is reinforced by a logic that takes the shape of a spiral. A new, shifted
					loop presents itself: not only does The Return stage events that seem to repeat those of
					the previous volume, it also includes these in a larger view, providing the framework of
					the first volume with a new series of events, upstream as well as downstream. Far from
					being a useless repetition, this movement has a destabilizing effect because the narrative,
					as it unfolds, systematically modifies many perceptions and certainties previously acquired
					by the reader who, confronted with these reversals (25), will be led to a new and surprising
					reconstruction of the way this universe works. Thus, the author's strategy can be perceived
					more clearly-far from minimizing the proximity to previous adventures, he builds on the
					reader's acquired knowledge and plays a structural game by introducing elements diverging
					from this knowledge (26). It is from this forced re-reading, maintained by the narrative
					structure and its shifts, that the feeling of confusion arises, which was effectively begun
					on the opening page (27).<BR/>

					As we have seen, in Andreas-quite apart from the important role played by the classic figures
					of his imagination and by his stylistics of representation-the effect of the fantastic has
					come to hinge rather on the fragile and yet decisive oscillation between the reality of
					the story and the ambiguity of its narrative. As Grivel (1992:27) has put it,
					"the fantastic serves as a tool for trickery in the logic of the narrative"
					(le fantastique désigne une feinte de la raison narrative). This is precisely why
					this genre lends itself so well to a study of narrative strategies and modes of
					expression aimed at achieving this effect of confusion.

					  were published simultaneously.
					  <BR/>5) To mention only a few examples, Mil's talisman recalls those of Parthington (father and son),
					  and the labyrinthine drawings on the same talisman share some characteristics with the key in
					  Cromwell Stone and with the numerical cube in Rork. Both Rork and Cromwell Stone have some
					  "frontier runners" among its characters, who use quite similar paths through caverns near
					  the coast with shipwrecks and monstrous carcasses lying around.
					  <BR/>6) Embodied, for example, by the classic figures of the monster or the "other world."
					  <BR/>7) These approximations (exo and endo-fantastic) are akin to what Todorov (1970) referred
					  to with his classification of the discourse of the fantastic in themes of "I" and "you."
					  <BR/>8) This "hystericalization of the medium", which he defines as based on "a concatenation of
					  effects driven to a point of superlative overheating," was first suggested in
					  Groensteen (1985:55) and explored in more detail in a subsequent article (Groensteen 1987: 33-35).
					  <BR/>9) These procedures, called "contraction" and "distortion," refer to the marked fragmentation
					  of specific pages, the vertical stretching of panels which impede the classic way of reading,
					  variation in the scale of representation with unexpected disconnections, the frantic
					  dance rhythm which seems to rule the postures of characters as well as the movement of
					  panels, the vertigo created by striated surfaces coming together, and a rhythmical
					  use of decorative elements (Groensteen 1987).
					  <BR/>10) Obviously, we have to make a distinction between the effects of oscillation and
					  confusion usually associated with the fantastic, and the perplexity brought about by the
					  nearly cryptogrammatic organization of stories like X-20 (Andreas, 1990), which are based
					  rather on the idea of the rebus.
					  <BR/>11) It should not be considered too strange to use the word "incipit" when talking about
					  a page rather than a panel in a comic strip, since perceiving the page panoptically allows
					  it to be seen (rather than read) in its entirety.
					  <BR/>12) From this point of view, another detail becomes a metaphoric mechanism, recalling
					  the juxtaposition of these two distinct but interconnected universes: the sets of stripes
					  (see Figure 1). Two sets are shown: the long lines of the venetian blinds (left) which cast
					  their shadow like a carpet on the floor, and the zebra-skin stripes. These two elements
					  reflect the polarization which makes the scene in this panel quite intriguing in itself:
					  modern civilization vs. traditional African civilization. Situated at the crossing of the
					  two sets of stripes in the key-space of the "column," Toby-Toby becomes the bearer of their
					  intersecting (the shadow cast by the blinds runs across him and is rippled by his clothes),
					  and thus of the universes that they evoke.
					  <BR/>13) It is remarkable how this opening page as a whole picks up the effect of its first panel:
					  it "hits" us like the slap scene. Displayed in a moment of intensity, the actions
					  (of both the first picture and the page) will not be integrated in an explanation until
					  later, counting essentially on their immediate effect of astonishment.
					  <BR/>14) In fact, Toby-Toby cannot be in the next room from Pestrone (why else would he hear
					  only his retorts and not the woman's?), and the idea that Toby's image represents Gina's
					  fantastical vision of herself, or, conversely, that the domestic row is nothing but
					  Toby's fantastical perception, is neither plausible (the same realistic representation codes
					  apply to the two parts of the same page) nor possible (because this idea is denied as
					  early as on the next page).
					  <BR/>15) Toby-Toby, identified as "Fato."
					  <BR/>16) Coutoo will take over Hingle's son, Krafft senior, and maybe Krafft junior.
					  <BR/>17) In A1 (first panel sequence, first picture) and A2, the characters are running
					  in the landscape; in A3 and A4 they look back towards their pursuers; exclamation in A5.
					  <BR/>18) In English every time, with the translation underneath, accompanied by a rather
					  closely resembling set of themes of the fantastic.
					  <BR/>19) ...because the main differences in composition turn out not to be differences after all:
					  the change in axis from an oblique separation of the panel sequences to a horizontal one
					  follows the change in focal direction of the characters, aiming for their goal. On the
					  other hand, a new element is introduced in the very precise line around the balloon:
					  three straight edges and one irregular side, scalloped, fringed in a pattern of waves
					  or mineral cracks (which lends a sepulchral tone to the utterance). The logic is quite
					  specific: it is the side closest to the vocal opening (the mouth) that presents this
					  characteristic. This highly stylized presentation of speech is emblematic of the
					  fantastic status of this story: it symbolizes the oscillation between reality and the
					  onset of improbability.
					  <BR/>20) The connection between the panels becomes a large curve (via the tree, the branch,
					  the scarf, and the head) that seems to press down upon the character.
					  <BR/>21) A link that will turn out to be representative of the relationship between the two volumes.
					  <BR/>22) This parallelism between the two incipit-panels is reinforced by the two epilogues,
					  which may be analyzed by the same twin-principle of resuming and shifting. The epilogue
					  page in The Return of Cromwell Stone announces its epilogue status and concludes
					  with a frontal image of a thankful character, but it also refers to another page in the
					  first volume (#33) by recalling some details (the dark panels, the fall, the creature with
					  tentacles), thus contributing to the questions which, inevitably, emerge at the end
					  of the reading.
					  <BR/>23) A series of "flashback sequences" in which a recitation of previous story parts is recalled.
					  <BR/>24) Even though these different temporal levels can ultimately be united in one point of view,
					  i.e., Crown's point of view in the first volume and Marlène's in the second.
					  25) For example, the threats that must be countered in the first story have now become types
					  of behavior that are to be encouraged.
					  <BR/>26) A similar approach can be found in Chantal Montellier's work.
					  <BR/>27) This feeling is even reinforced because nothing in the first volume seems, in any
					  explicit way, to lead up to a sequel, despite the realms of uncertainty typical of this
					  kind of narrative.

                    Unfortunately, it could be better, and in Kortrijk they still have not looked hard enough for
                    someone who could make a decent translation into Dutch. To my knowledge I have never
                    "een tas thee gedronken", or had "een vieze haar in de staart".
                    Although reading <REF ref="a50"/> gave me some idea. These minor details do not make reading
                    an album a pleasant undertaking and they take the speed from the story.
                    Specially if it concerns the beginning of a new series, creating the conditions for the
                    actual story. The story is set in the second half of 1992.
                    The inexperienced writer Ross Nevada has trouble getting his debut novel published.
                    This is followed by one setback after the other: his girlfriend leaves him,
                    the original manuscript of his debut disappears without a trace, and his mailbox
                    mysteriously keeps filling up more and more. Ross hitches a ride from an ufologist
                    but is kicked out of the car in Nowhereville. At the end of <REF ref="a50"/> a
                    (semi)religious manuscript is delivered to him and he receives the assignment to
                    write the biography of a billionaire. In the meanwhile somewhere in the South East
                    of the US a UFO is discovered.
                </TEXT>
                <TEXT>
                    So far the abstract of the story, or really the lack thereof. The first part
                    of a series is always hard. The loose wires that should eventually form the the story.
                    Moreover, the end of the album is not a cliffhanger that makes me yearn for more.
                    The story has more shortcomings. For instance, why should we be interested in the
                    problems of Ross Nevada? The only possible explanation is that he is named after
                    the well-known American town Rosswell, where so many weather balloons crash.
                    Undoubtedly, Nevada will be associated with the aliens in the newly discovered UFO,
                    and, knowing Andreas, will be part of the crew of the vehicle. Unfortunately we have
                    seen an earlier and more successful expression of an alien among men. And nobody is
                    waiting for a mix of Rork and the X-files. Not even the solid, yet soulless drawings
                    of <REF ref="p34"/> will help. <REF ref="a50"/> is not a must-have. Maybe the rest of the Mobilis
                    series will have some quality, but I fear the worst.

			<Comment showAt="a6">
                <TEXT title="(Rork volume 6, Le Lombard)">
					In this book we encounter, only three pages away from eachother, two of the nicest examples of Andreas page layouts.<BR /><BR />
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="Linearity of reading within one page (continuity principle)">
				<IMG src="resources/art_descente1.jpg" align="left" width="262" height="350"/>
				Page 17. Rork slides from a snowy slope and falls into a ravine. We see that the panels are positioned, and that the drawings in the panels are oriented, in such a manner, that the eye <B>follows</B> the fall without leaving the page.<BR /><BR />
				Comic art uses in general a "superimposed" storytelling: Reading the cases of the first strip, detaching the eye from the first strip, seeking and connecting with the second strip of panels, at the end detaching again from the page, seeking and connecting with the third strip, and so on... like the needle of a sowing machine. <BR /><BR />
				In this page, the eye "follows" the movement. By doing so, the artist creates a cinematographic effect by forcing the eye of the reader to actually follow the movement of the character. Additionally, the absence of detaching-seeking-connecting results in a more "fluent" reading. (peut-être un moins grand risque de briser l'illusion référentielle, si ce n'était déjà fait en exposant tant de plaisir à dessiner et découper) [translator: hard to comprehend the meaning of the original sentence]. <BR /><BR />
				I once talked about it to Andreas, who very modestly said "The Americans do it all the time". Here I think that Andreas is wrong. The mainstream comics, as I believe that those are the ones he was referring to, often guide the eye of the reader, but the most common effect is a simple diagonal allowing us to understand very fast, like publicity in printed media often oriented from top left to bottom right, the strategic direction.<BR /><BR />
				To summarize, lets say that its a way to reproduce our western way of reading. With Andreas, this system is more "Global" and never limited to one specific direction easing the reading of the page.<BR /><BR />
				Indeed, everybody who has just skimmed trough an album of Andreas will not have understood it. You only understand Andreas by reading, as a large part of the work has been left to do by the reader. <BR /><BR />
We can compare two, almost similar at first sight (guiding the eye), page layout effects while their application (diagonal versus winding movement) and envisioned effect (improved readability versus immersion in the story) is completely opposite.<BR /><BR />
We can read more about the cinematographic effect in <B>"Les Bijoux Ravis"</B>, from Benoît Peeters, where Hergé demonstrates this in the fall of Nestor from the stairs (pg 11 - The Castafiore Emerald)<BR /><BR />
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="Simultaneity of cases">
				<IMG src="resources/art_descente2.jpg" align="right" width="260" height="274"/>
				Lets take page 15 of the same album. Rork observes a globe that descends into a gullet. Andreas opposes the globe and Rork versus each other in two strips of two panels. The first panel containing the globe that descends, the second panel, Rork who observes it.<BR /><BR />
Both strips are framed left and right by a panel of the same height as the two individual panels. In order to "decode" the system, the reader has to understand by this "framing" that the two panels (although one placed above the other, and thus in comic language one happening <B>before</B> the other) are in fact happening <B>simultaneously</B>. <BR /><BR />
Another, maybe even stronger example, can be found in <B>"Lumière d'Etoile"</B>, fourth album of Rork, page 32. The man and the cat have a telepathic link, and the superimposed panels makes us understand this even before Shamah discovers it.<BR /><BR />
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="Conclusion">
				Throughout these examples (but there are plenty with Andreas), we start to understand that comic art does not have to be limited to "sequential" (linear) art. Comics can function also in a cinematographic or juxtaposed way. The page layout itself participates in the storytelling.<BR />

				<TEXT title="March 2011 - Photos and Twitter widget">
					Andreas send me a direct message on Twitter asking me if I was still interested in photos of his work environment.
					I was happily surprised, of course. He send me 6 e-mails, each containing 4 photos.<BR /><BR />
					
					I needed to find a way to present these photos in the same style as the rest of the site. But I also wanted to make them just a
					bit more special than the existing images. So I thought of the unorderly stack of photos metaphore, which I had seen before somewhere.
					It matched the 'dossier' style of the site pretty well I think. It's a bit corny, but that's fine.<BR /><BR />
					
					I needed to get rid of some of the tabs of the site, otherwise visitors might not even notice the Photos. I combined the
					minor tabs (Languages, Magazines, Persons, Publishers, Stories and Years) under the tab 'Index' and I added the tab Photos. I also removed
					the tabs 'About' and 'Notes' which are not so important and whose pages can still be reached via another route.<BR /><BR />
					
					I changed the homepage, because I wanted it to look more dynamic. So I added a twitter widget that I made on Twitter's site and
					I created a snippet of user added notes. This meant that I had to shorten the existing content, but it had been on the site too long anyway.
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="December 2008 - User contributions">
					Version 7 of the website is successful. I have received many compliments over time and this gives me the energy 
					to keep making the effort to keep the site up-to-date once in a while. Thanks!<BR /><BR />
					
					Since 2001 I have worked for two companies, Green Dino (2001 - 2005) and now, since 2005, Procurios.
					I am so excited about my current employer that I do a lot of overtime work and this keeps me from doing
					other stuff like expanding this website.<BR /><BR />
					
					In September 2003 I saw the birth of my spicy second daughter, Lila Sophia. She's now five years old and doing well at school.
					Jade Selene, my third baby girl, was born in January last year. She looks like me even more than the other two, but this may
					change of course. She will turn two next month and will then go to kindergarten. Katja and I love all three very much.<BR /><BR />
					
					Last year the site has had many problems with spammers flooding the guestbook. After some time I decided to turn vice into virtue
					by allowing all users to make notes on all pages of the site. By requiring everyone to be registered, I think I can keep spammers
					out and at the same time make it easier for wellwilling users to add to the content of the site.
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="April 2001 - On version 7">
					Since the site got only a 50 hits in 5 months time, and the only response was
					someone saying he could not download the plugin,
					I started thinking that
					the Java applet was the problem and that I should keep it simple. So I took
					the HTML pages I used to display in the Java applet browser component, extended
					them somewhat, added some chapters of "Andreas, une monographie", and some pictures,
					and here it is: version 7.
					<!-- Btw: it is still possible to visit version 6 at: <WWWlink href="http://balder.prohosting.com/~garfix/"/> -->
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="September 2000 - On version 6">
					I've taken 6 months off to build this latest version of the site. It gave me a chance to relax from
					the stress I experienced the years before and also to expand my knowledge of Java 2 and XML.<BR/>
					Among the techniques I used for this new site are: Java 1.3 (Swing, Corba, Java 2D, Jars),
					multithreading, client-server, XML (XLST, XPath), HTML (CSS). I use Java because it gives
					me a lot of possibilities and freedom. I used XML to generate the HTML pages. The static ones
					are placed in a pre-generated form in a jar file on the server, because the server (a 486 of my
					friend Danny) proved too slow to generate them on-line. The search pages are still generated on demand,
					so they may take a minute (or more) to generate (this takes only up to a few seconds on my Pentium II).
					I used Corba mainly to experiment with it.<BR/>
					Before I started, I thought that Corba was far superior to
					Sockets, but Sockets would have been easier and more flexible in hindsight. I can also run the site as
					an independent application on my own computer. So I've learned how to deal with resources in all kinds
					of ways. The site should be able to run on any platform that supports Java 1.3 and that has a Java
					plug-in available for its browser. It should run fine on Windows with Netscape Navigator, Internet
					Explorer and Opera. It should also run on Solaris, but I haven't tried that. I also designed it so
					that the main window can resize tolerably and that it can be run on resolutions from 640x480 up to
					1600x1200. Best viewing size is probably 1280x1024 because that is the resolution I use at home.<BR/>
					The police-dossier metaphor (borrowed, of course, from 'Coutoo') I invented to make the user interface
					look a bit 'messy'. Although the user interface should look messy, the underlying code should of course
					not be messy. I did everything I could to get the multithreading issues right. But there is still a problem
					remaining with the JEditorPane component I used to display the HTML pages (the ones with the 'Andreas'
					sticker on their upper-left). The HTML is loaded asynchronously, although I don't want it to. This
					occasionally causes a deadlock somewhere (I am sure it is a Swing problem, the JEditorPane is known to be
					problemsome), which hangs the applet :( . I thought I'd let you know.<BR/>
					The main part of the site is formed by (currently) eight articles on Andreas that can be read in two ways. They can be read as a whole. But the idea I started out with was that when you were interested in only one story or album, you should be able to read only the parts of the articles that had any information on it. So I worked this out elaborately. I hope you like it. The same information can be accessed in a number of different ways.<BR/>
					Personal stuff: My daughter was born! We called here Sky Sarah. She's a beautiful read-headed little girl. She's extrovert (unlike her parents) and is always surprised that not all other infants want to play with her. I hope she will be happy. My girlfriend Katja is not always that happy. She has to take care of the little brat most of the time which takes a lot of her. Also, she wants me to do stuff with her, like go out and see things. Maybe I am working on this website too much?
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="March 1999 - On version 5 (never published)">
					The site has been out of the air for almost a year now. It wasn't really gone, but the name of the server on which the site was located had changed (The computers were under attack of a hacker and changing the name was meant as a security measure.) My school's e-mail address was cut off as well, so I apologize to anyone trying to reach me. At that time I had too much stuff on my mind to work on the site.<BR/>
					The site has now completely changed. I now use threads linking the pages for two reasons. I can use the same information in different contexts very easily. And the site now has a form that Andreas could appreciate. It has a complexity in which one can get lost. This is intentional. Several other things have changed. I found a lovely girlfriend, named Katja, with whom I am living together. She's now already 7 months pregnant. I am still a student Cognitive Science and I am writing the master's thesis for it. At the same time I am working as a computer programmer for a middle sized IT company called PID.<BR/>
					I am using JavaScript 1.1 heavily. I intend to use JavaScript 1.2 for some parts, but in a way that shouldn't crash version 3 of the main browsers.
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="May 1998">
					The server named KUNPUX, on which this site is located, has been down for some
					time due to harddisk crash or something. Arggh! Luckily the maintainer of
					the server restored the site and AltaVista kept the link to it in its
					database, so everything is alright now. My enthusiasm for the site got
					renewed by a mail I got from <B>Philippe Sohet</B>, one of the two
					authors of the book on Andreas. He said he liked the site. He also
					mentioned a second book by them on Andreas that it to appear next year.
					The book has appeared in Dutch now, so I can finally read it.
					It will give some new input to the site, I'm sure. "Deliah" is out.
					Delightful book. It contains some interesting references to the Rork albums.
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="Jan 1998">
					Two Andreas-fans sent me mails saying they liked the site. They even said it
					is the most complete site on Andreas on the WWW. That's probably true,
					even though it contains only some very superficial information on the
					albums and 1 (now 2) interviews with Andreas. They definately increased
					my enthusiasm!<BR/>
					<B>Serge Simon</B> noted the publishing of 'Andreas,
					une monographie' and later sent me scans of the cover and back faces
					of the book. I have now ordered it myself. <B>Gil Damoiseaux</B>
					sent me a long e-mail mentioning his full Andreas collection,
					two interviews, the book and some interesting things about Schizo and
					Azteques (which I have now published). Later on he also sent scans of
					all 10 pictures from 'La messagere', the cover page of Azteques,
					a page from the book and the cover of  'Udolfo'. Thanks! I don't
					think I can publish all 10 scans for copyright reasons. If someone can
					convince me of the contrary, I will be happy to publish all of them.<BR/>
					I bought myself a French-Dutch lexicon on CD-ROM so I could translate
					some more interviews. After I spent some 5 hours translating an interview
					from Le Lombard, I found out that AltaVista has a translation-program
					publicly available. I corrected my version with the one generated by
					this program and I put it on the site. (Of course machine translation
					is never perfect, but I'm amazed at what this program can do!) The
					interview is distributed over 'Andreas', 'L'objet' and 'Arq'. The
					'Links' page has been extended. More links can be found by clicking
					on the publishers' icons.
				</TEXT>
				<TEXT title="December 1997 - Version 3">
					Launched the site on the university computer. Informed AltaVista, Yahoo, BDParadisio and Lombard of its existence. Filled in the whole form of Yahoo. Nothing happened with it. AltaVista is great. Searches with '+Andreas +Cyrrus' give me the first place! (with '+Andreas +Rork' I end up only at 46). BDCite made the first link to the site. Great feeling! BDParadisio has made a beautiful link to the site (beautiful refers to the lady in black).

					Sherpa heeft het plan om RORK te gaan herdrukken. Na lange besprekingen met Lombard blijkt nu dat L. van plan is de boeken te digitaliseren; met Franstalige herdrukken zal dan begonnen worden in 2007.
					Wij hopen dan mee te kunnen produceren voor de NL editie.<BR /><BR/>
					Voor herdrukken van Capricornus zijn vooralsnog (op korte termijn) geen plannen bij Lombard.<BR /><BR/>
					Vanwege een overlevering (teveel geleverd) van het derde deel van Cromwell Stone zal een speciale editie van dit boek binnenkort te verkrijgen zijn via www.sherpa.nu. Het betreft zon 75 exemplaren voorzien van een extra prent, in kleur, namelijk de tekening die Andreas maakte als cover voor de Franse editie. Boek en prent zijn genummerd, maar niet gesigneerd. De laatste kans voor Andreas-fans die het boek nog niet bemachtigd hadden. Het boek zal niet via de boekhandel verkrijgbaar zijn. De prijs wordt Euro 39,95, excl. verzendkosten.<BR/><BR/>
